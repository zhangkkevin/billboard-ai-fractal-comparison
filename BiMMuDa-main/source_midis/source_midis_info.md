# BiMMuDa's Source MIDI Files

In the early stages of dataset compilation, websites which provide free MIDI files were searched for high-quality MIDIs of the songs in the BiMMuDa to minimize the amount of manual transcription needed. Only MIDI files which met the following criteria were used:

  1. The MIDI file must contain the main (vocal) melody of the song in its entirety.
  2. The main melody of the song must be in its own individual track, so it can be easily isolated. 
  3. The transcription of the main melody must not be too interpretive or an arrangement. That is, the transcription should be as 
     straightforward and as close to the actual performance as possible. 

Very few of the MIDI files found met all three of these criteria. Many free MIDI files are for karaoke, so they do not contain the vocal melody. Many files place all instruments on the same track, making the main melody very time-consuming to isolate. Finally, some MIDI files are of arrangements or interpretations of songs rather than the songs themselves, making them unsuitable for the purposes of this dataset. 

Below is a list of songs in the dataset where the transcription was derived from a free MIDI file found online, either on freemidi.org. or bitmidi.com. These websites do not list the authors of these files. If you are an author of one of these MIDI files, please contact Madeline Hamilton at m.a.hamilton@qmul.ac.uk to be properly credited. 

Please note that these MIDI files were heavily edited before they were included in the BiMMuDa. The files in this directory are the original, unedited versions found online.
