Come on!

Does she walk? Does she talk?
Does she come complete?
My homeroom homeroom angel
Always pulled me from my seat
She was pure like snowflakes
No one could ever stain
The memory of my angel
Could never cause me pain

Years go by
I'm looking through a girly magazine
And there's my homeroom angel
On the pages in-between

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
Angel is the centerfold

Slipped me notes under the desk
While I was thinking about her dress
I was shy I turned away
Before she caught my eye
I was shaking in my shoes
Whenever she flashed those baby-blues
Something had a hold on me
When angel passed close by

Those soft and fuzzy sweaters
Too magical to touch
To see her in that negligee
Is really just too much

My blood runs cold (Yeah)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold (Oh yeah)
Angel is the centerfold

Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah

Now, look
It's okay I understand
This ain't no never-never land
I hope that when this issue's gone
I'll see you when your clothes are on
Take your car, yes, we will
We'll take your car and drive it
We'll take it to a motel room
And take 'em off in private

A part of me has just been ripped
The pages from my mind are stripped
Oh no, I can't deny it
Oh yeah, I guess I gotta buy it

My blood runs cold
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold
Angel is the centerfold
My blood runs cold (Woo!)
My memory has just been sold
My angel is the centerfold

Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
(Alright! Alright! 1-2-3-4!)
Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah, nah nah nah nah
Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah

My blood runs cold (Nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
My memory has just been sold (Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
My angel is the centerfold (Nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
Angel is the centerfold (Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
My blood runs cold (Oh yeah) (Nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
My memory has just been sold (Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
My angel is the centerfold (Nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
Angel is the centerfold (Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
(Nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
(Nah nah nah, nah nah nah nah)
