Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby jus' wrote me a letter

I don't care how much money I gotta spend
Got to get back to my baby again
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby jus' wrote me a letter

Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen mister, can't you see
I got to get back to my baby once more?
Any way, yeah

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby jus' wrote me a letter

Well, she wrote me a letter
Said she couldn't live without me no more
Listen mister, can't you see
I got to get back to my baby once more?
Any way, yeah

Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane
Ain't got time to take a fast train
Lonely days are gone, I'm a-goin' home
My baby jus' wrote me a letter

Because my baby jus' wrote me a letter
