Here's a happy tune you'll love to croon
They call it Sam's song
It's catchy as can be, the melody
They call it Sam's song

Nothin' on your mind
And then you'll find you're hummin' Sam's Song
Why, it makes you grin
Gets under your skin as only a song can do

People that you meet out on the street
All whistlin' Sam's Song
Everyone you see will soon agree
That it's a grand song
So forget your troubles and wear a smile
You'll find you never go wrong
If you learn to croon this happy tune
They call it Sam's song

"And now another treatment of this
Classic American Theme
Brought to you by, Mr. Gary Crosby"

Here's a happy tune
(That'll bring you a smile all the while
When you croon it you're really in style)
And the title is Sam's Song, it's catchy as can be
(With a sly little beat
And the melody sweet keeps you tappin' your feet)
And the title is Sam's Song

Nothin' on your mind
(But the news of the day and the bills you must pay
Keep your hair turnin' gray but you're still hummin' Sam's Song)
Are you alright, how's your brace
(Why, it makes you grin
Gets under your skin as only a song can do)

People that you meet
(Hello Joe, what you know and remind me to Moe
Tell him business is slow but I'm whistlin')
Sam's Song, everyone you see
(Has a story to tell or a gimmick to sell
But agree that it's swell and it's really)
A grand song

So forget your troubles and wear a smile
You'll find you never go wrong
If you learn to croon like a lark in the park
Who is making his mark serenadin' the dark
With a chorus of Sam's song

If you learn to croon the happy tune
They call it Sam's song
