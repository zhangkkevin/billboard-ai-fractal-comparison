Irene, goodnight. Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene.
I'll see you in my dreams.

Last Saturday night I got married.
Me and my wife settled down. Now, me and my wife are parted.
Gonna take a little stroll downtown.

Irene, goodnight. Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene.
I'll see you in my dreams.

Yeah, sometimes I live in the country
And sometimes I live in town. Yeah, and sometimes I take a great notion
I'm gonna jump in the river and drown.

Irene, goodnight. Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene.
I'll see you in my dreams.

Stop ramblin'. Stop that gamblin'.
Stop staying out late at night. Go home to your wife and family.
Stay there by the fireside, bright.

Irene, goodnight. Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene. Goodnight, Irene.
I'll see you in my dreams.
