Won't you play some simple melody
Like my mother sang to me?
One with a good old fashioned harmony
Play some simple melody

Musical demon, set your honey a dreamin’
Won't you play me some rag?
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag

If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Musical demon, set your honey a dreamin’
Won't you play me some rag?
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag

If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Musical demon, set your honey a dreamin'
Won't you play me some rag?
Just change that classical nag to some sweet beautiful drag

If you will play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all my applause
And that is simply because I wanna listen to rag

Play from a copy of a tune that is choppy
You'll get all of my applause because
I wanna rag it, ragtime melody
