Traveling in a fried-out Kombi
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said

Do you come from a land down under?
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six-foot-four and full of muscle
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"
And he just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said

I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better run, you better take cover, yeah

Lyin' in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me?
Because I come from the land of plenty"
And he said

Oh! You come from a land down under? (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? Ah
You better run, you better take cover
Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
(Hear, thunder) Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
You better, better run, you better take cover
Living in a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? Oh, yeah
You better run, you better take cover
Living in a land down under, oh
Where women glow and men plunder
(Yeah, yeah) Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder? (Yeah, yeah, thunder)
You better run, you better take cover
