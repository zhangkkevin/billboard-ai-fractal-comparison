The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine
The boy is mine

- Excuse me, can I please talk to you for a minute?
- Uh-huh, sure. You know, you look kinda familiar
- Yeah, you do too. But um, I just wanted to know, do you know somebody named...? You, you know his name
- Oh yeah, definitely. I know his name
- Well, I just wanna let you know that he's mine
- Ha, no, no, he's mine!

You need to give it up
Had about enough
It's not hard to see
The boy is mine
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine

I think it's time we got this straight
Let's sit and talk face to face
There is no way you could mistake
Him for your man, are you insane?
You see, I know that you may be
Just a bit jealous of me
But you're blind if you can't see
That his love is all in me
You see, I tried to hesitate
I didn't wanna say what he told me
He said without me, he couldn't make it
Through the day, ain't that a shame?
But maybe you misunderstood
'Cause I can't see how he could
Wanna change something that's so good
All my love was all it took (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (Oh)
The boy is mine (Boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Confused)
He belongs to me (Oh)
The boy is mine

Must you do the things you do?
You keep on acting like a fool
You need to know it's me, not you
And if you didn't know it, girl, it's true
I think that you should realize
And try to understand why
He is a part of my life
I know it's killing you inside
You can say what you wanna say
What we have, you can't take
From the truth, you can't escape
I can tell the real from the fake
When will you get the picture?
You're the past, I'm the future
Get away, it's my time to shine
If you didn't know, the boy is mine, oh (The boy is mine, oh-oh)

You need to give it up
Had about enough (Enough)
It's not hard to see (To see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Sorry that you)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up (Ooh)
Had about enough (Had about enough)
It's not hard to see

I'm sorry that you (I'm so sorry)
Seem to be confused (You seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine

I can't destroy this love I've found
Your silly games, I won't allow
The boy is mine without a doubt
You might as well throw in the towel
What makes you think that he wants you
When I'm the one that brought him to
The special place that's in my heart?
He was my love right from the start (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up (Give it on up)
Had about enough (Had about enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)

Had about enough (About enough)
It's not hard to see (It's not hard to see)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)
I'm sorry that you (Mine, oh)
Seem to be confused (Seem to be confused)
He belongs to me (He belongs to me)
The boy is mine (The boy is mine)

You need to give it up (Not yours)
Had about enough (But mine, not yours)
It's not hard to see (But mine, not yours)
The boy is mine (But mine)
I'm sorry that you
Seem to be confused
He belongs to me
The boy is mine
