Roses are red, my love
Du-du-du-du

A long, long time ago
On graduation day
You handed me your book
I signed this way

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

We dated through high school
And when the big day came
I wrote into your book
Next to my name

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you

Then I went far away
And you found someone new
I read your letter dear
And I wrote back to you

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But luck may God bless you

Is that your little girl?
She looks a lot like you
Someday some boy will write
In her book, too

Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you
Roses are red, my love
Violets are blue
Sugar is sweet, my love
But not as sweet as you
