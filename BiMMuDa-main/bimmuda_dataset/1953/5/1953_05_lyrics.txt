You, you, you
I'm in love with you, you, you
I could be so true, true, true
To someone like you, you, you

Do, do, do
What you oughta do, do, do
Take me in you arms, please do
Let me cling to you, you, you

We were meant for each other
Sure as heavens above
We were meant for each other
To have, to hold and to love

You, you, you
There's no one like you, you, you
You could make my dreams come true
If you say you love me too

We were meant for each other
Sure as heavens above
We were meant for each other
To have, to hold and to love

You, you, you
There's no one like you, you, you
You could make my dreams come true
If you say you love me too
