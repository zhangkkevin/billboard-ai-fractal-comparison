Lately when I'm in my room
All by myself
In the solitary gloom
I call to myself

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
Love never made a fool of you
You use to be too wise

Hey there
You on that high flyin' cloud
Though he won't throw a crumb to you
You think someday he'll come to you

Better forget him
Him with his nose in the air
He has you dancin' on a string
Break it and he won't care

Won't you take this advice I hand you like a mother
Or are you not seein' things too clear
Are you too much in love to hear?
Is it all goin' in one ear and out the other

Hey there
You with the stars in your eyes
(Are you talking to me?)
Love never made a fool of you
(Not until now)
You used to be too wise
(Yes, I was once)

Will you take this advice I hand you like a mother
Or am I not seein' things too clear
Are you just too far gone to hear?
Is it all goin' in one ear and out the other
