Wanted
Someone who kissed me
And held me closely
Then stole my heart

Wanted
Someone I trusted
Who gave no warning
We'd ever part

She was last seen
Hiding out in someone's arms
He knew nothing
Of the danger in her charms

A jury
May find her guilty
But I'd forgive her
If I could see

A signed confession
That she's repented
And really wanted
No one but me
