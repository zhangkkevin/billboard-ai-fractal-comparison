(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
(Ba-ba-ba-boom)

(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Take me in your arms and never let me go
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Whisper to me softly while the moon is low
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Hold me close and tell me what I wanna know
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Say it to me gently, let the sweet talk flow

Come a little closer
Make love to me

(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Kiss me once again before we say goodnight
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Take me in your lovin' arms and squeeze me tight
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Put me in a mood so I can dream all night
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Everybody's sleepin' so it's quite all right

Come a little closer
Make love to me

When you're near, so help me, dear
Chills run up my spine
Don't you know I love you so?
I won't be happy till you're mine

(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
When I'm in your arms you give my heart a treat
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Every time we kiss you make my life complete
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Baby doll, you know ya swept me off my feet

Now's the time to tell you
Make love to me

I won't be happy till you're mine

(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
When I'm in your arms you give my heart a treat
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Everything about you is so doggone sweet
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Every time we kiss you make my life complete
(Ba-ba-ba-ba-boom)
Baby doll, you know ya swept me off my feet

Now's the time to tell you
Hey, baby make love to me
