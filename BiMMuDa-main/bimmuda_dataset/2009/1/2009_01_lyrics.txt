Yo, I got that hit to beat the block
You can get that bass on below
I got that rock 'n' roll, that future flow
That digital spit, next level visual shit
I got that boom boom boom
How the beat bang? Boom boom boom

I like that boom boom pow
Them chickens jackin' my style
They try to copy my swagger

I'm so three thousand and eight
You so two thousand and late

Y'all hear that spaceship zoom

Them girls go apeshit, mmm
Y'all stuck on Super 8 shit
That lo-fi stupid 8-bit

This beat go boom boom bap

I'm a beast when you turn me on
Into the future, cybertron
Harder, faster, better, stronger
Sexy ladies, extra longer
'Cause we got the beat that bounce
We got the beat that pound
We got the beat, that 808
That boom boom in your town

People in the place
If you wanna get down
Put your hands in the air

Yup, yup
