You took your coat off and stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
And I watched from my window
Always felt I was outside looking in on you
You're always the mysterious one with
Dark eyes and careless hair
You were fashionably sensitive
But too cool to care
You stood in my doorway with nothing to say
Besides some comment on the weather

Well, in case you failed to notice
In case you failed to see
This is my heart bleeding before you
This is me down on my knees

These foolish games are tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You're always brilliant in the morning
Smoking your cigarettes and talking over coffee
Your philosophies on art
Baroque moved you
You loved Mozart and you'd speak of your loved ones
As I clumsily strummed my guitar

Well, excuse me
Guess I've mistaken you for somebody else
Somebody who gave a damn
Somebody more like myself

These foolish games are tearing me, you're tearing me
You're tearing me apart
And your thoughtless words are breaking my heart
You're breaking my heart

You took your coat off
Stood in the rain
You're always crazy like that
