Oh-oh

A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a busta
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time and

No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

Well a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass, so

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time

No, I don't want no scrub

Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

If you don't have a car and you're walkin'
Oh, yes son, I'm talkin' to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh, yes son, I'm talkin' to you (Baby)
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh, yes son, I'm talkin' to you
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No scrub
No scrub, no, no
No scrub, no, no, no, no
No scrub, no, no
