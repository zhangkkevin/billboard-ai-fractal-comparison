(So rare, so rare)
(So rare, so rare)

So rare, you're like the fragrance of blossoms fair
Sweet as a breath of air fresh with the morning dew
So rare, you're like the sparkle of old champagne
Orchids in cellophane couldn't compare to you

You are perfection, you're my idea
Of angels singin' the "Ave Maria"
Or you're an angel, I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare, this is a heaven on earth we share
Caring the way we care, ours is a love so rare

(So rare, so rare)
(So rare, so rare)

(You are perfection, you're my idea)
(Of angels singin' the "Ave Maria")
Or you're an angel, I'd breathe and live you
With every beat of the heart that I give you

So rare, (so rare) this is the heaven on earth we share (so rare)
Caring the way we care (so rare) ours is a love so rare

(So rare, so rare)
(So rare, so rare)
