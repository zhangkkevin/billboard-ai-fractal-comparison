Ah ya ya ya ya ya
Ya ya ya ya ya ya ah

Hey, little darlin'
Oh Little darlin'
Oh ho where are you
My Love-ah I was wrong-ah
To try to love you

Ah ooh ah ooh ah ohh ah

No way-ah
That my love-ah
Was just for you
For only you

My darlin', I need you to call my own
And never do wrong
To hold in mine your little hand
I'll know too soon that all is so grand. Please hold my hand

My dear-ah
I was wrong-ah
To try to love you

Ah ooh ah ooh ah ohh ah

No way-ah
That my love-ah
Was just for you
For only you
