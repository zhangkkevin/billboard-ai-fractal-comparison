Thought I heard your voice yesterday
Then I turned around to say that I loved you, then I realized
That it was just my mind
Playing tricks on me
It seems colder lately at night
And I try to sleep with the lights on
Every time the phone rings I pray to God it's you
I just can't believe that we're through

I miss you (I miss you)
There's no other way to say it (And I), and I can't deny it
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see, I miss you and me

Is it done and over this time?
Can we really change our minds? But it's our first love
All the feelings that we used to share
I refuse to believe that you don't care

I miss you (I miss you)
There's no other way to say it (And I), and I can't deny it
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see

I've got to gather my senses together
I've been through worse kinds of weather
If it's over now, I'll be strong, I can't believe that you're gone
I've got to carry on, but

I miss you (I miss you)
Oh, no other way to say it (And I), and I can't deny it
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see that you're part of me now

Oh, no other way to say it
It's so easy to see that you're part of me now
It's drivin' me crazy
It's so easy to see that you're part of me now, that you're part of me now

I miss you (I miss you)
It's drivin' me crazy, I don't want to live without you
I miss you (I miss you)
It's so easy to see I'm missin' me
