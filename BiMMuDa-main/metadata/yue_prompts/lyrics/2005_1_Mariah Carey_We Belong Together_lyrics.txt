[Verse]
I didn’t mean to walk away  
But I had no words left to say  
Now I’m lost in yesterday  
Wishin’ you were here to stay  

[Chorus]
We belong together, don’t you see  
It’s your voice that still sets me free  
In every song, in every prayer  
I reach for you, and you’re not there  

[Verse]
Time moves on but I remain  
Caught in whispers of your name  
You were my shelter, now I roam  
In your memory I call home  

[Bridge]
If I could turn back all these nights  
I’d hold you close, make it right  

[Chorus]
We belong together, don’t you see  
It’s your voice that still sets me free  
In every song, in every prayer  
I reach for you, and you’re not there  

[Outro]
We belong together
