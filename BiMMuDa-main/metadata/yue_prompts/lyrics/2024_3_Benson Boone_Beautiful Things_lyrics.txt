[Verse]
Every step I took, you cracked  
But still I gave and never lacked  
Your love was sharp behind the glow  
A beauty no one else could know  

[Chorus]
Glass heart, don’t break again  
Held you close, but lost a friend  
You shine, but cut so deep  
In your silence, I can’t sleep  

[Verse]
I watched you fall, then turn away  
Each shard a word I couldn’t say  
Now I tiptoe through what’s left  
Trying not to lose my breath  

[Bridge]
If I had gloves made out of grace  
Maybe you'd have stayed in place  

[Chorus]
Glass heart, don’t break again  
Held you close, but lost a friend  
You shine, but cut so deep  
In your silence, I can’t sleep
