[Verse]
We said goodbye, but hearts don’t lie  
And time can’t make this feeling die  
Though distance grows and seasons change  
There’s something that will stay the same  

[Chorus]
You’ll always be my baby  
Even when the world turns crazy  
Our song won’t fade, it won’t erase  
I’ll always feel your warm embrace  

[Verse]
We took a path we couldn’t see  
But love still holds the memory  
You were my first, you’ll be my last  
A present bound to all my past  

[Bridge]
If you ever need to find your way  
I’ll be here every day  

[Outro]
You’ll always be my baby, true  
No matter what we’re going through
