[Verse]
The first time ever I saw your face  
The world stood still in quiet grace  
No word could reach what I had found  
Your gaze alone could shake the ground  

[Chorus]
I knew then what forever meant  
In that one moment, heaven sent  
You held the stars within your eyes  
And turned my silence into skies  

[Verse]
The first time ever you touched my hand  
The earth became a softer land  
No fear, no doubt, just endless peace  
And all my ghosts were released  

[Bridge]
Time could pass and oceans roam  
But you, my heart, will be my home  

[Outro]
The first time ever I saw your face  
Love began its sweetest chase
