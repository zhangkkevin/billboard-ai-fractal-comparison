[Verse]
Hey soul sister, what’s your name?  
You light up rooms like summer flame  
You dance on beats no one can hear  
But I feel it every time you're near  

[Chorus]
You're my one, my midnight song  
The melody where I belong  
Hey soul sister, don’t let go  
We found the rhythm long ago  

[Verse]
Your eyes write lines in harmony  
Your laughter's sweet like poetry  
We might be odd, but we're just right  
You bring the color to my night  

[Bridge]
And when the silence steals the tune  
You hum me back beneath the moon  

[Chorus]
You're my one, my midnight song  
The melody where I belong  
Hey soul sister, don’t let go  
We found the rhythm long ago
