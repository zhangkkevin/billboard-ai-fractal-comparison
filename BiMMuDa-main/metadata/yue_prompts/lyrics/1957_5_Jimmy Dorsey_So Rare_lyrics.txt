[Verse]
So rare, your smile at dawn  
Like jazz notes drifting on and on  
Your touch is silk, your breath a breeze  
You bring me gently to my knees  

[Chorus]
So rare, like midnight's tune  
A saxophone beneath the moon  
You move like rhythm in the air  
Darlin’, you're beyond compare  

[Verse]
You swirl like smoke from candle light  
A mystery bathed in velvet night  
One kiss from you, I lose control  
You jazz my heart, you stir my soul  

[Bridge]
They don’t make love like this no more  
You’re the sound I can't ignore  

[Outro]
So rare, so smooth, so fine  
You’ll always be that spark of mine
