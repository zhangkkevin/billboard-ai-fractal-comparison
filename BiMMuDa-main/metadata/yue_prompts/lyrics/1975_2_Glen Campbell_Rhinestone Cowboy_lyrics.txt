[Verse]
I walk these streets with dreams in tow  
A quiet name, a steady glow  
The flashing lights don’t know my name  
But I keep riding just the same  

[Chorus]
Like a rhinestone cowboy  
Chasing lights through smoke and noise  
Riding high on dreams and grace  
Still smiling through this worn-out face  

[Verse]
They laugh at hope, they mock the tune  
But I keep dancing to my moon  
I’ve worn out boots, but not my pride  
With every fall, I still ride  

[Bridge]
Fame may come or pass me by  
But I’ll keep reaching for the sky  

[Outro]
I’m just a rhinestone cowboy  
But this dream will never die
