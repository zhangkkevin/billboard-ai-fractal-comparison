[Intro]
Here we go back, this is the moment  

[Verse]
I came from the bottom, learned to rise  
With fire in my voice and stars in my eyes  
A dream too big, a heart too loud  
Can’t hold me down, I break the crowd  

[Chorus]
Can’t hold us, we go high  
Chasin’ dreams into the sky  
Turn the beat up, raise your voice  
Make the world feel your choice  

[Verse]
March with pride through every street  
No defeat when you move your feet  
Say my name, I’m not ashamed  
I built this fire, I feed the flame  

[Bridge]
No ceiling, no cage  
This is freedom on a stage  

[Chorus]
Can’t hold us, we go high  
Chasin’ dreams into the sky  
Turn the beat up, raise your voice  
Make the world feel your choice  

[Outro]
Let the people sing
