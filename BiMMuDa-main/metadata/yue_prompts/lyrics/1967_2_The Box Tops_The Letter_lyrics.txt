[Verse]
Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane  
Got no time to take the train  
My baby wrote, said come back soon  
Now I’m flying to that tune  

[Chorus]
The letter said she still believes  
She’s waitin’ there beneath the eaves  
One piece of paper, black and blue  
Told me what I had to do  

[Verse]
I read her words a thousand times  
Each line ringing like chimes  
She said, “Come home, don’t delay  
I miss you more with each day”  

[Bridge]
No more nights alone for me  
Her words set my heart free  

[Outro]
The letter brought her voice so near  
Now I’m coming home, my dear
