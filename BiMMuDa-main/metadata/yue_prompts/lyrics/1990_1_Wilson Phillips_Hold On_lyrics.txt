[Verse]
Storms may come, and skies may fall  
But deep inside, I hear the call  
There’s a voice that won’t let go  
A strength I’ve come to know  

[Chorus]
Hold on, through the night  
Even when there’s no light  
Hope will rise, it’s not gone  
You’ve got to keep holding on  

[Verse]
Tears may fall, and hearts may bend  
But this pain is not the end  
Every shadow hides a flame  
You will never be the same  

[Bridge]
Time will heal what broke apart  
Love will lead your tired heart  

[Outro]
Hold on, just a little more  
There’s a new world to explore
