[Verse]
There was a time, I walked alone  
But then you came and changed the tone  
A gentle voice, a crimson light  
You pulled me through the endless night  

[Chorus]
Like a kiss from a rose  
Soft and sharp, the way love goes  
You bring the cold and then the heat  
A contradiction so complete  

[Verse]
Your love is deep, your touch divine  
It lingers long beyond the line  
Of what I thought that love could be  
You bloomed and took the heart of me  

[Bridge]
With every breath, you draw me near  
I crave the danger and the fear  

[Outro]
Like a kiss from a rose again  
You're my joy and my pain
