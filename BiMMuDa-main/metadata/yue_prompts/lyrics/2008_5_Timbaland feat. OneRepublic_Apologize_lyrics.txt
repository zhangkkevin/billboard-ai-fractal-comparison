[Verse]
I'm holding on to something gone  
These words feel weak, I can’t go on  
You said you’d stay, but now you’re cold  
This love’s too cracked to hold  

[Chorus]
It’s too late to apologize  
I needed truth, not pretty lies  
I gave my heart, you let it break  
Now all I feel is the ache  

[Verse]
I took a chance, you watched me fall  
Tried to stand, you gave no call  
Now here I am, still reaching out  
But you turned silence into doubt  

[Bridge]
Don’t say sorry, it’s past due  
I needed more than that from you  

[Chorus]
It’s too late to apologize  
I needed truth, not pretty lies  
I gave my heart, you let it break  
Now all I feel is the ache  

[Outro]
It’s too late
