[Verse]
You say the words, I read your eyes  
We both been playin', no surprise  
It's a game of tease and taste  
We’re moving close with just enough space  

[Chorus]
Promiscuous girl, I see your flame  
In this heat, we play no name  
Talk that talk, keep it smooth  
But we both know what we wanna do  

[Verse]
You say you're different, I say I might  
But here we are late at night  
You're my match, my spark, my style  
Let's not pretend for just a while  

[Bridge]
Don't say love, just say tonight  
Let’s disappear before the light  

[Chorus]
Promiscuous girl, I see your flame  
In this heat, we play no name  
Talk that talk, keep it smooth  
But we both know what we wanna do
