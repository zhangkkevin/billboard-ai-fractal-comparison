[Verse]
There’s a silence in the room tonight  
You reach for me, but I’m out of sight  
I’m not lost, just far away  
Still I love you every day  

[Chorus]
When I’m gone, don’t close your heart  
Keep my name where the memories start  
When the light fades and the night feels long  
Just remember me in a song  

[Verse]
I see your tears though I’m not there  
Every moment, I’m everywhere  
I’ll be the wind when you feel alone  
The voice that calls you home  

[Bridge]
I’ll never leave, I’ll never stray  
Just close your eyes, I’m on my way  

[Chorus]
When I’m gone, don’t close your heart  
Keep my name where the memories start  
When the light fades and the night feels long  
Just remember me in a song  

[Outro]
Remember me
