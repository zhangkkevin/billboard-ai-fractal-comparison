[Verse]
Well I walk down the street and I can't sit still  
Got a jitter in my heart, like a spinning thrill  
Every time you look my way  
My words just jump and slip away  

[Chorus]
I'm all shook up, can’t lie  
Don’t know how or even why  
But darlin’, when you hold me tight  
I feel like dancing through the night  

[Verse]
My knees go weak, my hands feel light  
Your kiss hits harder than neon light  
The jukebox sings our favorite tune  
And I’m flying like a red balloon  

[Bridge]
I tried to play it cool and smooth  
But baby, you just shake my groove  

[Outro]
I’m all shook up, and that’s just fine  
'Cause now I know that you are mine
