[Verse]
If I could run away today  
Find a place where skies don’t gray  
I’d pack the past and let it go  
Find the sweet escape I used to know  

[Chorus]
Let’s make this the sweet escape  
A place where we don’t break  
No more lies and no more tears  
Only love, only cheers  

[Verse]
You say I’m wrong, I say I try  
We always clash, then wonder why  
Let’s find a way to make it right  
Leave all the pain back in the night  

[Bridge]
Take my hand, let’s disappear  
No one else, just us right here  

[Chorus]
Let’s make this the sweet escape  
A place where we don’t break  
No more lies and no more tears  
Only love, only cheers
