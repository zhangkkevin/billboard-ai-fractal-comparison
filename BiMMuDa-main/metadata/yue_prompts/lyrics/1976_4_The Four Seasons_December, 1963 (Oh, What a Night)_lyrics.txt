[Verse]
Oh what a night, so full of charm  
Your touch, your voice, your warming arms  
I never knew love moved that fast  
But still I wish it all could last  

[Chorus]
Oh what a night, a flash of flame  
Everything changed when you said my name  
A memory that wonâ€™t let go  
From long ago, I still feel the glow  

[Verse]
You smiled and time began to freeze  
With every breath, you brought me peace  
The stars came down just for us two  
And lit a path that felt brand new  

[Bridge]
Even now, the years have passed  
But that one night, it still holds fast  

[Outro]
Oh what a night, we danced so free  
And that night still lives in me
