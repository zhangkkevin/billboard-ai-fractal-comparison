[Verse]
Down at the end of Lonely Street  
There's a place where lost hearts meet  
Where broken dreams check in to stay  
And love just packs and walks away  

[Chorus]
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel  
Where echoes cry and memories dwell  
You can leave your smile outside  
Inside here, the tears don’t hide  

[Verse]
The neon flickers, the silence hums  
I count regrets like ticking drums  
No one knocks and no one calls  
Just me and shadows on the walls  

[Bridge]
Once we danced, now I recall  
The steps we missed, the final fall  

[Outro]
So if you’re hurtin’, come on in  
Heartbreak Hotel will always let you in
