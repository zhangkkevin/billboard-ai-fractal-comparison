[Verse]
Saw her smile and felt the sting  
She's got everything, every little thing  
But she’s with him and I pretend  
That I’m just another friend  

[Chorus]
I wish I had Jessie’s girl  
The way she laughs, she lights my world  
It’s tough to hide what I feel inside  
When he’s the one right by her side  

[Verse]
We hang out, but I feel the ache  
Watching him make the moves I’d make  
She doesn’t know what she could mean  
To someone caught in between  

[Bridge]
I’m not trying to steal or lie  
But I dream about her every night  

[Outro]
I wish I had Jessie’s girl  
But some dreams never unfurl
