[Verse]
Loneliness is haunting me  
And now I feel the need to plead  
You were the spark that lit my flame  
Now silence echoes out your name  

[Chorus]
Hit me baby one more time  
Say you’re mine and draw the line  
Between the doubt and what we were  
Just bring me back with one sweet word  

[Verse]
The days are slow, the nights too deep  
You’re the dream I can’t keep  
I lost my way when you let go  
But still your name is all I know  

[Bridge]
My heart’s still caught in our old rhyme  
Craving just one final sign  

[Outro]
Baby, call me back again  
Let me feel your love begin
