[Verse]
We tried to hold what couldn’t stay
Watched love grow quiet, drift away
We shared the truth without the flame
And walked away without the blame

[Chorus]
It’s too late, we can’t go back
Time rolled on without a track
The words are soft, the nights are still
But we can’t change the way we feel

[Verse]
You used to wait at midnight’s call
Now silence dances through the hall
We smile like we both understand
Love sometimes slips right through your hand

[Bridge]
It wasn’t wrong, it wasn’t right
Just a moment lost to night

[Outro]
It’s too late for us to mend
But thank you for being more than friend
