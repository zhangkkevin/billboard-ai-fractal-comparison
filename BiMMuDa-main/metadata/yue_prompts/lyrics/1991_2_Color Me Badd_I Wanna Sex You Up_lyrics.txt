[Verse]
Midnight falls, I feel the fire  
Your touch is all that I desire  
No more words, just body heat  
In your arms, I’m complete  

[Chorus]
I wanna sex you up  
Feel the night, don’t interrupt  
Let the rhythm lead us on  
Till the breaking of the dawn  

[Verse]
The candlelight, the silent room  
Your perfume dancing through the gloom  
Every breath you take, I crave  
Every sigh, a wave I brave  

[Bridge]
No need to slow, just let it flow  
Take me where you always go  

[Outro]
I wanna sex you up tonight  
Make it real, make it right
