[Verse]
Came from the bottom, had no voice  
Now I’m top floor, made my choice  
They boxed me in, I broke the frame  
Every win still wears my name  

[Chorus]
I’m out the box, no lock, no key  
They doubted hard, but now they see  
This grind don’t stop, it don’t sleep  
Got that hustle, cut so deep  

[Verse]
Diamonds flash, the wrist say time  
But I still work like every dime  
This ain’t luck, this is my climb  
Made a mountain outta grime  

[Bridge]
Can’t trap a soul that’s built to rise  
You see the truth behind these eyes  

[Chorus]
I’m out the box, no lock, no key  
They doubted hard, but now they see  
This grind don’t stop, it don’t sleep  
Got that hustle, cut so deep
