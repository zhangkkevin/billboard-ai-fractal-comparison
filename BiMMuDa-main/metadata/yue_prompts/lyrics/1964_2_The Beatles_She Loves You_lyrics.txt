[Verse]
You said she cried the other night  
You didn’t hold her quite so tight  
But love like hers don’t fade away  
She’s got so much left to say  

[Chorus]
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah  
You better not throw it all away  
She needs you, can’t you see?  
She’s where your heart should be  

[Verse]
You thought you'd find someone new  
But no one shines the way she do  
Take her hand, say you're sorry  
Start again, no need to worry  

[Bridge]
Don’t wait for love to slip away  
She’s yours if you just say  

[Outro]
She loves you, yeah yeah yeah  
So love her back today
