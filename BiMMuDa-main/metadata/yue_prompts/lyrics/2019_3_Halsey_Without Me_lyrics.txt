[Verse]
I built you up from broken parts  
Gave you breath, gave you a heart  
You stood tall, then walked away  
Left me in the storm you made  

[Chorus]
You had it all, because of me  
But now you’re gone, and now I see  
I gave too much, you took too free  
So tell me how it feels without me  

[Verse]
You made me feel like second best  
Then blamed me while you took your rest  
I fought for two, you let it die  
You can’t fake truth behind a lie  

[Bridge]
I was the glue, now you’re unmade  
The price of all the love betrayed  

[Chorus]
You had it all, because of me  
But now you’re gone, and now I see  
I gave too much, you took too free  
So tell me how it feels without me
