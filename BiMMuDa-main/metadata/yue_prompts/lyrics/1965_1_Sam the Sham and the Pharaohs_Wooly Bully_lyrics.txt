[Verse]
Wooly Bully’s got the groove  
Makes your body wanna move  
With a stomp and twist and shout  
We’re gonna turn this party out  

[Chorus]
Wooly Bully, dance all night  
Spin around and hold on tight  
Forget your worries, jump in line  
Wooly Bully's feelin’ fine  

[Verse]
Sam told Matty not to wait  
Said get down and shake that fate  
It’s not about how you look  
It’s the rhythm that you cook  

[Bridge]
It don’t matter what you wear  
Long as you got moves to share  

[Outro]
Wooly Bully, here we go  
Let that wild energy flow
