[Verse]
I jump in the ride and cruise the town  
From the beach to the strip, I get around  
Engine roars and the tires spin  
Every night’s a new begin  

[Chorus]
I get around, I make my scene  
From the boulevard to the movie screen  
With the windows down and music loud  
I move fast and live proud  

[Verse]
The girls all smile, the guys all nod  
I’m known from Venice down to Cape Cod  
Surfboard strapped, ready to go  
Speedin’ off with style and glow  

[Bridge]
You can’t catch me, I’m never still  
Movin’ through life by sheer will  

[Outro]
I get around, it’s what I do  
Racing with the sun in view
