[Verse]
No stars tonight, no morning light  
Since you walked out, nothing feels right  
I reach for you in empty space  
And only find the air's embrace  

[Chorus]
I can't live, if living is without you  
Every breath just pulls me through  
You were the song, the only truth  
And now I'm lost in all I knew  

[Verse]
The mirror shows a different face  
One touched by time and love's disgrace  
But I'd give all to hold your gaze  
And bring back those golden days  

[Bridge]
Love’s a flame that won’t die down  
Even when no one's around  

[Outro]
I can't live, and yet I try  
But I still break, and I still cry
