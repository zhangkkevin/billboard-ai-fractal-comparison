[Verse]
Desperate eyes are scanning the sky  
I’m chasing the reasons I feel so alive  
Tumbling fast with no way to land  
Gripping tight with a trembling hand  

[Chorus]
I’m hanging by a moment with you  
Caught in the breath between the truth  
No more questions, nothing left to prove  
I’m hanging by a moment, by a moment with you  

[Verse]
The wind is screaming but I hear your name  
The world keeps moving but I remain  
Right here where the silence grows  
You’re the only thing I’ve ever known  

[Bridge]
I don’t need tomorrow if tonight is enough  
Falling into pieces, falling into love  

[Chorus]
I’m hanging by a moment with you  
Caught in the breath between the truth  
No more questions, nothing left to prove  
I’m hanging by a moment, by a moment with you  

[Outro]
Just a moment, just with you
