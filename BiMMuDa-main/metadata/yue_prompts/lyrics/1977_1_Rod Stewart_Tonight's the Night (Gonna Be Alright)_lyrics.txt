[Verse]
The candles glow, the room is still  
My heart is racing, hard to chill  
You look at me with knowing eyes  
Tonight, no fear, no more goodbyes  

[Chorus]
Tonight’s the night, it’s gonna be alright  
We’ll move so slow, then hold on tight  
The stars outside will fade away  
While in your arms I choose to stay  

[Verse]
We've waited long, we've crossed the line  
This love is yours, this love is mine  
Let music lead us through the dark  
Till morning brings a brand new spark  

[Bridge]
There’s no need to talk or run  
Our hearts are sure, our time’s begun  

[Outro]
Tonight’s the night, come close to me  
Let love unfold so tenderly
