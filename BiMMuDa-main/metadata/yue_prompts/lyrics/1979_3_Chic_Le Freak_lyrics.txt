[Verse]
Step into the flashing light  
Lose your worries for the night  
Grab your coat and strike a pose  
This is where the fever grows  

[Chorus]
Freak out! Le freak, c’est chic  
Let the rhythm make you weak  
Freak out! And feel alive  
In the groove, we thrive and jive  

[Verse]
No need to talk, no time for shame  
Just let the music stake its claim  
The floor is hot, the crowd’s on fire  
We’re lifted by this one desire  

[Bridge]
Hands in the air, let’s elevate  
It’s our turn to celebrate  

[Outro]
Le freak, c’est chic, don’t stop the sound  
We’ll dance until we shut it down
