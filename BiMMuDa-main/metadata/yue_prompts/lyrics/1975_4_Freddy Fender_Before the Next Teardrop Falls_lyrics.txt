[Verse]
If he breaks your heart again  
If you need a softer friend  
I’ll be here with open arms  
To pull you safe from all harm  

[Chorus]
Before the next teardrop falls  
I’ll catch your sorrow as it calls  
No need to face the night alone  
I’ll guide you gently back home  

[Verse]
If he forgets the way you shine  
Just know your light is always mine  
I won’t replace what’s left behind  
But I’ll be here, tender and kind  

[Bridge]
Sometimes love can disappear  
But I’ll be standing always near  

[Outro]
Before the next teardrop shows  
I’ll be the one who always knows
