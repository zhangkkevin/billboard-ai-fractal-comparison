[Verse]
Rising up, back on the street  
Chasing dreams that won’t retreat  
Took my hits, stood my ground  
Now I’m back for another round  

[Chorus]
It's the eye of the tiger, the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our might  
With the last known survivor stalking his prey  
In the night, we find our way  

[Verse]
Went the distance, paid the cost  
Fought through doubt, loved and lost  
But now I see what I can be  
A fire forged in destiny  

[Bridge]
Every scar a memory  
Of how I fought to still believe  

[Outro]
It’s the eye of the storm I crave  
The strength to rise, the will to brave
