[Intro]
Hot, so hot in here  
Let's go! Uh  

[Verse]
Step in the room, all eyes on me  
DJ got the beat that sets us free  
Sweat drippin’, temperature risin’  
We in this club, no compromisin’  

[Chorus]
It’s hot in here, take it slow  
Move your body, lose control  
From the wall to the floor  
Let 'em know you want some more  

[Verse]
Shorty workin’ like she know  
Tonight we lose, tomorrow’s low  
Champagne pop, lights go red  
And I forgot what I just said  

[Bridge]
Clothes off, lights dim, bass bumpin’, let’s begin  

[Chorus]
It’s hot in here, take it slow  
Move your body, lose control  
From the wall to the floor  
Let 'em know you want some more  

[Outro]
Yeah, it’s gettin’ hot
