[Verse]
Wise men say to guard your heart  
But I’ve been lost from the very start  
You look at me and time stands still  
And I surrender all my will  

[Chorus]
I can’t help falling in love  
You fit me like a glove  
With every word and every sigh  
You lift me gently to the sky  

[Verse]
Like rivers flow into the sea  
I drift and settle where you’ll be  
Though paths may twist, I’ll stay with you  
In every dawn, in every view  

[Bridge]
So take my hand and lead me slow  
Where love is all we’ll ever know  

[Outro]
Can’t help falling, it's true  
I was always meant for you
