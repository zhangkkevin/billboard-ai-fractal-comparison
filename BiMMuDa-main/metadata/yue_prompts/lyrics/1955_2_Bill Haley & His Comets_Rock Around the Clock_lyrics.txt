[Intro]
One, two, three o'clock, rock!  

[Verse]
Put on your shoes and slick your hair  
We’re going dancing anywhere  
The jukebox jumps, the rhythm swings  
Let’s see what this ol’ night brings  

[Chorus]
We’re gonna rock around the clock tonight  
Turn up the heat, hold your baby tight  
From twelve to three, then back again  
We’ll keep on rockin’ ‘til the end  

[Verse]
Jump and jive with all your might  
Forget your troubles, feel the light  
We’re spinning wild on checker floors  
With every beat, we want more  

[Bridge]
The world may sleep but we won’t stop  
We’re jukin’ hard ‘til the needle pops  

[Chorus]
We’re gonna rock around the clock tonight  
Turn up the heat, hold your baby tight  
From twelve to three, then back again  
We’ll keep on rockin’ ‘til the end
