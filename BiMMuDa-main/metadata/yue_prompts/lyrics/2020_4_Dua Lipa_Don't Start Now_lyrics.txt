[Verse]
I was born in the storm, made to fight  
Wrote my story under streetlight  
Kept my pain beneath the gold  
Now my truth is being told  

[Chorus]
I’m a rockstar, scars and steel  
Every moment raw and real  
From the curb to stadiums loud  
I stand alone, but I’m proud  

[Verse]
They don’t know what I’ve seen  
Still I shine like a dream  
I got blood in every line  
This ain't just rap, it’s mine  

[Bridge]
If you knew the price I paid  
You’d never call this just fame  

[Chorus]
I’m a rockstar, scars and steel  
Every moment raw and real  
From the curb to stadiums loud  
I stand alone, but I’m proud
