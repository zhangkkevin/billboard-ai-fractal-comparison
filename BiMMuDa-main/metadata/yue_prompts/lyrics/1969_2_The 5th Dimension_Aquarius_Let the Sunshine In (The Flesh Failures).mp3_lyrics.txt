[Intro]  
When the stars align as one  
And the rivers meet the sun  
When the night forgets to stay  
A brand new time will find its way  

[Verse]  
This is the age of the open soul  
When love and truth will take control  
When hearts connect across the land  
And no one’s left to make a stand  

[Chorus]  
Awakening, it’s in the sky  
Rising now, so don’t ask why  
The veil is gone, we’re looking clear  
A world reborn is drawing near  

[Verse]  
We've been lost in fear too long  
Hiding what we know is wrong  
Now the dawn begins to sing  
And the bells of change will ring  

[Chorus]  
Open up the light  
Let the bright shine in  
Open up the light  
Let the bright shine in  

[Bridge]  
Let it shine on you! (Let it shine on you!)  
Let it shine on me! (Let it shine on me!)  
Let it shine on love! (Let it shine on love!)  
Let us all be free! (Let us all be free!)

[Chorus]  
Open up the light  
Let the bright shine in  
Let the bright  
Shine in
