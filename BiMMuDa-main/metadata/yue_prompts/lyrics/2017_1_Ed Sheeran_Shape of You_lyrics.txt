[Verse]
The bar was loud, your smile was clear  
I felt the rhythm pull me near  
You talked of life and simple things  
And every word made my heart sing  

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you  
The way you move, the things you do  
From your laugh to your morning song  
In your arms, where I belong  

[Verse]
We talked all night, we danced till two  
Forgot the world, just me and you  
No diamonds, no parade  
Just a bond that couldn’t fade  

[Bridge]
Your body’s art, but there’s more inside  
You’re the truth I never hide  

[Chorus]
I'm in love with the shape of you  
The way you move, the things you do  
From your laugh to your morning song  
In your arms, where I belong
