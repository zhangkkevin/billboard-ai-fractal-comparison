[Verse]
We’re just dancing, just pretend  
But every touch begins to bend  
The lines we drew, the words unsaid  
Now spinning inside my head  

[Chorus]
You're standing too close  
Every heartbeat shows  
That I can’t resist the heat  
When your body moves to this beat  

[Verse]
We said it's nothing, we said it's fun  
But now I’m melting in your sun  
Your breath on me, your hands in time  
Got me thinking, crossing the line  

[Bridge]
We’re lost in this song tonight  
But it don’t feel right  

[Outro]
Too close to turn away  
Too close to not stay
