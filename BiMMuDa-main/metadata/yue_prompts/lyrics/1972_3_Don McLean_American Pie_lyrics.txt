[Intro]
A long, long time ago, I can still remember how that music made me smile...

[Verse]
I read the news on a winter's day  
The songs we loved had slipped away  
No more guitars to fill the night  
Just silent halls and neon light  

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, the songs we used to know  
Drove our dreams through the dust and snow  
And though the rhythm’s gone from the sky  
We’ll still remember, we won’t say goodbye  

[Verse]
The jester laughed, the poet cried  
The crowd grew still, the groove had died  
But we held hands, still swaying slow  
To songs from years and lives ago  

[Bridge]
It wasn’t just a melody  
It was the sound of you and me  

[Outro]
So bye, bye, to that sweet refrain  
Till we hear those chords again
