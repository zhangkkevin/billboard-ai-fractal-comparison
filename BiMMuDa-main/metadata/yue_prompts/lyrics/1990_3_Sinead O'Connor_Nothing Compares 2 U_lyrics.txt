[Verse]
It's been hours, it's been days  
Since you walked your separate ways  
And though I try to clear my mind  
You're the thought I always find  

[Chorus]
Nothing compares to you  
No one else sees me through  
I tried to laugh, I tried to run  
But every joy fades when you’re gone  

[Verse]
They say time can heal the soul  
But I still feel the gaping hole  
I wear your name behind my eyes  
You were my earth, my sky  

[Bridge]
Even in a world brand new  
There’s nothing that compares to you  

[Outro]
No light, no sound, no hue  
Can match what I had with you
