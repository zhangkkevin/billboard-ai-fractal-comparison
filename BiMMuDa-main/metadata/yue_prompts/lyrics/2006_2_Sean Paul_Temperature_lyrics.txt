[Intro]
Yow! Dutty yeah!  

[Verse]
Gyal wind it up, set the fire  
Make the dancefloor lift up higher  
We blaze hot, like summer sun  
Work that waist, don’t stop till done  

[Chorus]
Raise the temperature, feel the beat  
Wine and twist, move your feet  
Every motion, every sound  
We mash it up and shut it down  

[Verse]
From Kingston down to JA  
Gyal a move like holiday  
Pulse beatin’ like riddim drum  
When the DJ drop that bomb  

[Bridge]
Hotter than fire, hotter than flame  
Call my name, it ain’t no game  

[Chorus]
Raise the temperature, feel the beat  
Wine and twist, move your feet  
Every motion, every sound  
We mash it up and shut it down  

[Outro]
So raise the temp and feel the heat
