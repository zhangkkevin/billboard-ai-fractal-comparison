[Intro]
Hey Maca-Macarena!

[Verse]
She’s got the moves that light the floor  
Turns and twists, we ask for more  
Hands up high, hips so clean  
Dance like a queen, you know what I mean  

[Chorus]
Hey Maca-Macarena (Ayy!)  
Dance all night with Macarena  
Wave your hands, turn around  
Now bring it back down to the ground  

[Verse]
All the boys stop when she’s near  
She’s got the style, she’s got no fear  
Shake to the left, slide to the right  
Macarena’s got it locked tonight  

[Outro]
Hey Maca-Macarena! (One more time!)  
Hey Maca-Macarena!
