[Intro]
RedOne! Let's go!  

[Verse]
I lost my phone, but I found the light  
My heels too high, but I feel all right  
Hands in the air, beat’s on repeat  
Movin’ wild on reckless feet  

[Chorus]
Just dance, it's gonna be okay  
Spin it up and fade away  
DJ, let the record play  
Just dance, it's all okay  

[Verse]
Club’s on fire, I’m in control  
Tonight I'm free, I bare my soul  
Through the rhythm, I escape  
One more drink and no mistake  

[Bridge]
Music saves me, every time  
I lose my fear and find my mind  

[Chorus]
Just dance, it's gonna be okay  
Spin it up and fade away  
DJ, let the record play  
Just dance, it's all okay
