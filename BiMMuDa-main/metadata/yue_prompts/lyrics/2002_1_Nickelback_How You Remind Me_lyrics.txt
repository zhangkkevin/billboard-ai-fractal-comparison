[Verse]
I wake up chasing words I never said  
Your voice still echoes in my head  
You were the spark, I was the flame  
Now only ashes know my name  

[Chorus]
This is how you remind me  
Of the man I swore I’d never be  
It’s not your fault, it’s not just mine  
We lost ourselves somewhere in time  

[Verse]
You said forever, I said soon  
We built our love beneath the moon  
Now all the nights feel cold and wide  
I still hear you on the other side  

[Bridge]
If I could take it back, I would  
But I’m not sure it’d do us good  

[Chorus]
This is how you remind me  
Of the man I swore I’d never be  
It’s not your fault, it’s not just mine  
We lost ourselves somewhere in time  

[Outro]
You remind me
