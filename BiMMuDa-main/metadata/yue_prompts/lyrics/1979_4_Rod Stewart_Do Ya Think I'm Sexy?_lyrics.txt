[Verse]
You see me there, across the floor  
With eyes that ask for something more  
You like the way I tilt my smile  
You’ve been watching all the while  

[Chorus]
Do ya think I’m sexy? Say it true  
Wanna feel the heat between us two  
All this tension, don’t pretend  
We both know how this will end  

[Verse]
Your touch is slow, but eyes are fast  
We’re moving closer, make it last  
I’m not here to play it coy  
I want the thrill, I want the joy  

[Bridge]
Say the word and I’ll respond  
To every spark, to every bond  

[Outro]
Do ya think I’m sexy? Take the lead  
Let’s give this fire what it needs
