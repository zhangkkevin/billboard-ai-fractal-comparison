[Verse]
We started out so sure, so strong  
But somewhere, we both went wrong  
Now we’re standing face to face  
In a quiet, shattered place  

[Chorus]
It’s the end of the road  
But my heart still bears the load  
Though we can’t pretend anymore  
I’m not ready to close the door  

[Verse]
Memories dance like broken light  
Through every lonely, sleepless night  
I’d give it all, I’d take the fall  
If you’d just answer when I call  

[Bridge]
Sometimes love just slips away  
Even when you beg it to stay  

[Outro]
End of the road, but I still try  
To love you beyond goodbye
