[Verse]
To the left, to the left  
Everything you own in a box to the left  
You had your chance, you played your game  
Now you're standing there, calling my name  

[Chorus]
I’m irreplaceable, don’t get it wrong  
I found my strength, I’m moving on  
You thought I’d break, but here I stand  
I got the world right in my hand  

[Verse]
I gave you love, I gave you time  
All you did was cross the line  
Now I’m rising, watch me shine  
You had your shot, now I’m just fine  

[Bridge]
You thought I'd wait, you'd come back through  
But baby, I was done with you  

[Chorus]
I’m irreplaceable, don’t get it wrong  
I found my strength, I’m moving on  
You thought I’d break, but here I stand  
I got the world right in my hand
