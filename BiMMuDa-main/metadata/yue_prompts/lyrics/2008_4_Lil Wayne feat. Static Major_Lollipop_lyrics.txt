[Intro]
She said, "Go ahead and taste it..."  

[Verse]
Shorty got that sugar twist  
Make a player reminisce  
She got fire in her stride  
Turnin’ heads when she ride  

[Chorus]
She lick me like a lollipop  
Won’t stop ‘til the beat drop  
Candy sweet, yeah it’s wild  
Got me lost in her style  

[Verse]
Her touch is heat, her lips are gold  
This kind of love don’t ever get old  
Turn the lights down, let it roll  
Tonight she got full control  

[Bridge]
One more taste, I lose my mind  
She got that vibe that’s hard to find  

[Chorus]
She lick me like a lollipop  
Won’t stop ‘til the beat drop  
Candy sweet, yeah it’s wild  
Got me lost in her style
