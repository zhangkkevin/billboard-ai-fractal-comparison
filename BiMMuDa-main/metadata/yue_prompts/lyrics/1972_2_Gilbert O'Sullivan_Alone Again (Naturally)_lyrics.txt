[Verse]
I stood and watched the door close tight  
No words, no chance to make it right  
The laughter faded into air  
And I was left with no one there  

[Chorus]
Alone again, naturally  
The world forgot to wait for me  
I tried to smile through broken glass  
But memories hold on so fast  

[Verse]
I questioned why the good ones leave  
While sorrow teaches us to grieve  
I held the past in trembling hands  
And wished for someone who understands  

[Bridge]
Faith can fall, and hope feels thin  
But I still breathe and start again  

[Outro]
Alone again, maybe true  
But someday Iâ€™ll believe in new
