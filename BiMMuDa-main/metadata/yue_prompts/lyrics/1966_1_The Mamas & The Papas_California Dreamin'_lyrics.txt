[Verse]
I stepped into a world of gray  
With sunlight trapped so far away  
The wind was cold, the sky was wide  
But dreams of warmth were locked inside  

[Chorus]
California dreamin’, every single night  
Wishing for the golden light  
Walking through the silent snow  
But my heart’s where the palm trees grow  

[Verse]
I passed the church with doors of stone  
But in my chest, I felt alone  
I whispered prayers I couldn't speak  
Longing for the coast and heat  

[Bridge]
If I could fly beyond this chill  
I’d trade this frost for every thrill  

[Outro]
California dreamin’, holding on so tight  
To the color in the fading light
