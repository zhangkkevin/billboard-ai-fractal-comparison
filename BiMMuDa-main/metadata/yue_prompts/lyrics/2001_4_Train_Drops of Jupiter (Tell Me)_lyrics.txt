[Verse]
She’s back again with stardust eyes  
Walks like thunder through my skies  
She’s got that look that speaks of space  
As if she’s seen another place  

[Chorus]
Did you fly beyond the clouds?  
Did you chase the comets down?  
Did you find the reason why?  
And did you miss me in the sky?  

[Verse]
She tastes like rain and sounds like dreams  
Tells me stories ripped at seams  
She’s been where maps just lose their way  
But somehow she still finds today  

[Bridge]
And I’ve been waiting here below  
For signs that only you would know  

[Chorus]
Did you fly beyond the clouds?  
Did you chase the comets down?  
Did you find the reason why?  
And did you miss me in the sky?  

[Outro]
Now that you’re back, stay awhile
