[Verse]
You got the smile, you got the charm  
You turn the heat without alarm  
When you walk, they stop and stare  
There's magic rising in the air  

[Chorus]
You got personality, style and soul  
Make the dullest day feel whole  
Can’t explain, it’s just you  
Every move, every groove you do  

[Verse]
When you laugh, the party starts  
You’ve got the keys to every heart  
You don’t need riches, don't need fame  
Just one word and they chant your name  

[Bridge]
You're the spark the night admires  
Setting off a thousand fires  

[Outro]
You got personality, loud and clear  
You're the reason I’m still here
