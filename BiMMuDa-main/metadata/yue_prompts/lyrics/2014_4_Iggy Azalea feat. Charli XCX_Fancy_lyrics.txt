[Intro]
First things first...  

[Verse]
Rollin’ through the city lights  
Turnin’ heads, we own the night  
From the runway to the street  
Got that fire, feel the heat  

[Chorus]
We so fancy, watch us glow  
From the ceiling to the floor  
Flash that gold, make ‘em freeze  
We write the rules, we do as we please  

[Verse]
Champagne flutes and tinted glass  
Breakin’ hearts with every pass  
Don’t need a crown, don’t need a throne  
We shine harder on our own  

[Bridge]
Catch us now, or miss the ride  
We the storm, we the tide  

[Chorus]
We so fancy, watch us glow  
From the ceiling to the floor  
Flash that gold, make ‘em freeze  
We write the rules, we do as we please
