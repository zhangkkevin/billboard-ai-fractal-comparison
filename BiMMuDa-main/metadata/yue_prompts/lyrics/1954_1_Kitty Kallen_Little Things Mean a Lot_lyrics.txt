[Verse]
Send me no diamonds, no golden rings  
Just hold me close through simple things  
A whispered word, a gentle smile  
Can carry me for quite a while  

[Chorus]
Little things mean a lot  
More than treasure I haven’t got  
A note you leave, a loving glance  
Turns every day into romance  

[Verse]
You don’t need to climb a hill  
Just kiss my hand and time stands still  
It’s not the world I long to see  
It’s every little thought of me  

[Bridge]
You don’t need to speak a lot  
One soft hug says all you’ve got  

[Outro]
So hold me near, don’t let it drop  
Those little things mean a lot
