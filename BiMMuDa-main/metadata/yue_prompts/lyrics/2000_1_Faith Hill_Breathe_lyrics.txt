[Verse]
I've been holding it inside  
Hiding feelings that collide  
But now it's time to let it go  
Let the truth begin to show  

[Chorus]
Just breathe, let it in  
Feel the air beneath your skin  
No more running, no disguise  
Only truth behind these eyes  

[Verse]
The world spins fast, we lose our place  
But peace can come with just one grace  
Slow it down, be here, be still  
Let your soul bend to your will  

[Bridge]
You don't need to know the end  
Only breathe, my love, again  

[Outro]
Breathe with me, donâ€™t pretend  
This is where the healing begins
