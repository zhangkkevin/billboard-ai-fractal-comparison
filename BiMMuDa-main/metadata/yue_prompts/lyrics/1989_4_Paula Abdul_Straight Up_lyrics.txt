[Verse]
Are you playing or is this real?  
I need to know just how you feel  
No more riddles, no more games  
Say it clear or end the flames  

[Chorus]
Straight up, now tell me  
Are you gonna be with me?  
No more dancing in disguise  
Just the truth behind your eyes  

[Verse]
I’ve waited long, I’ve been through lies  
I’m not fooled by your disguise  
If it’s love, then let it show  
If it’s not, I need to know  

[Bridge]
You can’t keep my heart on hold  
Say it fast, say it bold  

[Outro]
Straight up, don’t make me guess  
Is this love or just a mess?
