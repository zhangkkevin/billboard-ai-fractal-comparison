[Intro]
Oh my gosh  

[Verse]
She walked in and lit the floor  
Every eye said “I want more”  
Drop that beat, she owns the vibe  
Feels like the best night of my life  

[Chorus]
O-M-G, she’s blowin’ my mind  
Can’t look away, not this time  
Everything about her’s tight  
She got me sayin’ it all night  

[Verse]
Lights go low, she don’t slow down  
Body rollin’ to the sound  
She’s a fire I can’t fight  
Lost in her, it feels so right  

[Bridge]
This must be some kind of dream  
But she’s real and she’s on my team  

[Chorus]
O-M-G, she’s blowin’ my mind  
Can’t look away, not this time  
Everything about her’s tight  
She got me sayin’ it all night  

[Outro]
O-M-G
