[Verse]
Late night echoes through my mind  
I hear your name, the sweetest kind  
But you're a ghost I can’t embrace  
Still chasing light in empty space  

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Heat waves crashin' through  
In my head like summer’s breeze  
You haunt my quietest memories  

[Verse]
We said forever, now it fades  
Like fire lost in rainy shades  
I talk to shadows, call your name  
But nothing ever feels the same  

[Bridge]
If time could bend or turn around  
I'd still be lost, but you’d be found  

[Chorus]
Sometimes all I think about is you  
Heat waves crashin' through  
In my head like summer’s breeze  
You haunt my quietest memories
