[Verse]
You said I wasn’t good enough  
Made me question all my stuff  
Turned my heart to second place  
But I’ve moved on from your embrace  

[Chorus]
So if you like the way you look so much  
Maybe you should love yourself  
You tore me down with every touch  
But I’ve found someone else  

[Verse]
I used to chase your point of view  
Now I see what’s really true  
You played the game, you played it well  
But now I’ve left your little shell  

[Bridge]
Don’t need your name to feel complete  
I’ve learned to stand on my own feet  

[Chorus]
So if you like the way you look so much  
Maybe you should love yourself  
You tore me down with every touch  
But I’ve found someone else
