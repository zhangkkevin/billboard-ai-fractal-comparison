[Intro]  
Clock keeps ticking, moonlight's high  
I need a spark, I need to fly  

[Verse]  
Been working hard all week alone  
My echo bouncing off the phone  
The night is calling loud and clear  
I want someone to pull me near  

[Chorus]  
I wanna dance with somebody  
Who knows how to move with me  
I wanna spin with somebody  
Where love and rhythm run free  
Don’t wanna sway with just anybody  
I wanna dance with somebody who loves me  

[Verse]  
I’ve played the cool, I’ve played the game  
But midnight’s never felt the same  
Without your laugh, without your hand  
This dance floor feels like sinking sand  

[Bridge]  
I don’t need a fairy tale  
Just someone real who will not bail  

[Chorus]  
I wanna dance with somebody  
Who makes my worries fade away  
I wanna dance with somebody  
Who’ll stay till break of day  

[Outro]  
Yeah, I wanna dance with somebody who loves me
