[Verse]
Catchin' the last train out of town  
Before the sun goes down  
Left a note on your pillowcase  
Said I'm leavin' without a trace  

[Chorus]
Meet me at the station, don’t be late  
There’s no time left to hesitate  
Clarksville’s callin’, tracks are loud  
But I still want you in the crowd  

[Verse]
Suitcase rattles, heartbeats race  
I still see your face  
Every mile just pulls me near  
I need your voice to calm my fear  

[Bridge]
Don't know when I’ll be back again  
But hold me close until then  

[Outro]
One last ride, one last chance  
Let’s run away, not miss the dance
