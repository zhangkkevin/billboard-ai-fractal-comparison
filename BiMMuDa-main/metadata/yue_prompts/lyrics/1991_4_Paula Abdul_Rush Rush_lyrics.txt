[Verse]
Waiting by the window frame  
Whispering your secret name  
Time is slow, but my heart flies  
Searching through the clouded skies  

[Chorus]
Rush, rush into my arms  
Let me drown in all your charms  
Take me now, don’t think twice  
Let’s get lost in paradise  

[Verse]
Every second drips like rain  
But you erase my every pain  
Don’t delay, don’t let this fade  
This kind of love can’t be delayed  

[Bridge]
When I dream, it’s always you  
Running fast and pulling through  

[Outro]
Rush, rush, into the flame  
We’ll never be the same
