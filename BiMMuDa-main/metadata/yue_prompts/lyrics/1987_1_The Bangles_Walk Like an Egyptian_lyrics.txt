[Verse]
Streets are buzzing, heads turn quick  
Everyone's got a new trick  
Moving feet with ancient grace  
Through the rhythm, time's erased  

[Chorus]
Walk like an Egyptian  
Feel the pulse, no prediction  
Strike a pose, hold it strong  
Let the beat just drag you along  

[Verse]
Paint your eyes with golden fire  
Every stare a wild desire  
Hands like wind, hips that slide  
With history at your side  

[Bridge]
Step in line with mystery  
Dance your way through history  

[Outro]
Walk like an Egyptian tonight  
Underneath the neon light
