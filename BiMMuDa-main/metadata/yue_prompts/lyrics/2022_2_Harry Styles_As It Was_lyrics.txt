[Verse]
Hold the phone, I’m not the same  
Time has carved a brand new name  
What we had is in the past  
But somehow, it still holds fast  

[Chorus]
As it was, we danced in light  
Now the silence owns the night  
Things have changed, and so have we  
Still I miss what used to be  

[Verse]
The world keeps turning, yet I stay  
Trapped in echoes of your way  
Your voice like wind I can’t outrun  
Fading with the setting sun  

[Bridge]
We said goodbye without a sound  
But I still feel you all around  

[Chorus]
As it was, we danced in light  
Now the silence owns the night  
Things have changed, and so have we  
Still I miss what used to be
