[Verse]
There’s a fire in every soul  
Waiting quietly to take control  
In the stillness of the night  
A hero rises into the light  

[Chorus]
You don’t need to wear a crown  
To lift someone who’s falling down  
Look inside, and you will know  
You’ve had the strength to grow  

[Verse]
Through the tears and aching fear  
You’ve been the one to persevere  
Not for fame or glory’s call  
But just to rise after you fall  

[Bridge]
It’s not in words or grand display  
It’s in the hearts you guide each day  

[Outro]
There’s a hero in you, it's true  
And the world is better because of you
