[Intro]
Are you ready for a perfect storm?  

[Verse]
I play with lightning in my veins  
I kiss the fire, break the chains  
Don’t say yes unless you know  
Once you fall, I won’t let go  

[Chorus]
This is magic, dark and deep  
I’ll haunt your soul, I’ll steal your sleep  
You asked for power, now you see  
I’m the one you couldn’t read  

[Verse]
Velvet words, a diamond lie  
I paint my spells across the sky  
You thought you’d win this little game  
But now you're caught inside my flame  

[Bridge]
Be careful with the wish you cast  
Not every love is meant to last  

[Chorus]
This is magic, dark and deep  
I’ll haunt your soul, I’ll steal your sleep  
You asked for power, now you see  
I’m the one you couldn’t read
