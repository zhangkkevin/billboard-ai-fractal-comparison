[Verse]  
I’ve crossed the miles and braved the dark  
To chase the echo of your spark  
Every moment, near or far  
I’ve kept your name within my heart  

[Chorus]  
Everything I do, I do it for you  
Every breath I take, every sky I move through  
There’s no dream too high, no storm too wide  
I’d face it all with you by my side  

[Verse]  
I’ve turned away from easy roads  
Carried silence, heavy loads  
But loving you is what feels right  
You’re my reason, my guiding light  

[Bridge]  
If the world should fall apart  
I’ll still stand with open heart  

[Outro]  
Everything I do, I do it for you  
For love that’s pure and true
