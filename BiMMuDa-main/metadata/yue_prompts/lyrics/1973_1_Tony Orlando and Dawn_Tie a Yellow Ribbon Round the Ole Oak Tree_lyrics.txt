[Verse]
I’ve been gone for far too long  
Felt every mile, wrote every song  
Now I’m coming back to see  
If you’ve been waiting still for me  

[Chorus]
Tie a yellow ribbon ‘round the ole oak tree  
If you still care, if you still want me  
One ribbon means I’m welcome home  
If not, I’ll keep moving on alone  

[Verse]
The road was hard, the nights were cold  
But your memory, it took hold  
I dreamed of you and that old porch swing  
Of second chances love can bring  

[Bridge]
The bus is near, I hold my breath  
Will I find love or find regret?  

[Outro]
Tie that ribbon if you believe  
And I’ll never again leave
