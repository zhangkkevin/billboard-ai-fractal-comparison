[Verse]
Hit the floor, it’s goin’ down  
Feel the heat rise from the ground  
Every beat's a shot of light  
Turn it up, let loose tonight  

[Chorus]
Jump! Shake off all your fears  
We’re dancing through the years  
Jump! Like you’ve never known  
You’re never in this alone  

[Verse]
Hands up, don’t hesitate  
This groove can’t wait  
The rhythm’s here to set you free  
It’s where you’re meant to be  

[Bridge]
Feel the fire in your bones  
This is where your spirit hones  

[Outro]
Jump! And own the night  
Make it yours, make it right
