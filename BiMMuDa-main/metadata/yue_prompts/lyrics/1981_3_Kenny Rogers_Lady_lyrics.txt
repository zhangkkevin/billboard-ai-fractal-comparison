[Verse]
Lady, you came into my life  
Soft and calm, a break from strife  
You turned my night into a song  
A place where hearts belong  

[Chorus]
Lady, you are my light  
The one who makes wrong feel right  
In your arms I find my truth  
You are my dream, my fountain of youth  

[Verse]
With every word you speak my name  
You set my world alight with flame  
You're every wish Iâ€™ve ever made  
A love that will not fade  

[Bridge]
I was lost till you appeared  
Now I hold what I once feared  

[Outro]
Lady, stay and never leave  
In you I always will believe
