[Intro]  
Who can twist the sunshine?  
Sprinkle joy on everything?  
Wrap a smile in laughter?  
The Bubblegum King!

[Verse]  
He’s got pockets full of color  
Shoelaces made of sweets  
He skips around the corner  
Tappin’ rhythms with his feet  
When he sings, the sky gets brighter  
Birds all start to swing  
You know it’s not just anyone  
It’s the Bubblegum King!

[Chorus]  
Oh, the Bubblegum King can (yes he can!)  
He can take your frown and turn it ‘round again  
With a pop and a grin and a song from within  
He’ll lift your day like helium wind  

[Bridge]  
Don’t need no gold, no diamond things  
Just bubble wrap and jelly wings  
He’s got a heart that’s sugar-spun  
And bounces joy to everyone!

[Chorus]  
Oh, the Bubblegum King can (yes indeed!)  
He’s got every happy thing you need  
From peppermint hats to chocolate shoes  
He gives the world the sweetest news  

[Outro]  
So if you feel blue and gray  
Let the Bubblegum King save your day!
