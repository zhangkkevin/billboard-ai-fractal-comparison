[Verse]
Strike a pose, no need to talk  
Let your body do the walk  
In the spotlight, bold and free  
You’re a living legacy  

[Chorus]
Vogue, feel the beat  
Let your style become elite  
Every step, a work of art  
Every move, a brand new start  

[Verse]
Lift your head and find the frame  
Turn the mirror into fame  
Grace and power in your stance  
This is more than just a dance  

[Bridge]
You’re the moment, you’re the muse  
In your hands, the world you choose  

[Outro]
Vogue, and don’t look back  
You were born to light the track
