[Verse]
We’ve been through storms, we’ve faced the rain  
But now we’re here, we’ve shed the pain  
It’s time to breathe, to laugh again  
To let the sunshine in  

[Chorus]
It’s just like starting over  
Learning love beneath the clover  
Every kiss a brand new spark  
We’re lighting fire in the dark  

[Verse]
We took the long and winding road  
Carried burdens, heavy load  
But now we stand with open hearts  
Ready for a brand new start  

[Bridge]
Every touch feels like the first  
Every silence quenches thirst  

[Outro]
It’s just like starting over  
With the one I’ve always known
