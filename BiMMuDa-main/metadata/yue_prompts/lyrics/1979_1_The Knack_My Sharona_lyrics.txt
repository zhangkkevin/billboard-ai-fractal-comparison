[Verse]
Every look, it pulls me in  
You're the fire beneath my skin  
Fast and loud, you steal the show  
I can't stop, I can't let go  

[Chorus]
My Sharona, heart attack  
You knock me down and pull me back  
You're the rhythm in my veins  
Driving me a little insane  

[Verse]
Every move, a wicked beat  
You dance like chaos on the street  
You're the rush I chase each night  
My wild addiction, my delight  

[Bridge]
Say the word, I'll lose control  
Youâ€™ve got a grip upon my soul  

[Outro]
My Sharona, take me high  
You're the reason I can't lie
