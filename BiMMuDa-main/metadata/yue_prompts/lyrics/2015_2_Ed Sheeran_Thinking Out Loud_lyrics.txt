[Verse]
When your smile has faded lines  
And your eyes lose track of time  
I will still be standing near  
Holding all you are, my dear  

[Chorus]
I’m thinking out loud tonight  
Loving you just feels so right  
We may grow old and slow  
But I’ll never let you go  

[Verse]
When the stars forget to shine  
I’ll remind them that you're mine  
Every wrinkle, every scar  
Maps the road to where you are  

[Bridge]
Hearts don’t age when they belong  
To the soul that wrote their song  

[Chorus]
I’m thinking out loud tonight  
Loving you just feels so right  
We may grow old and slow  
But I’ll never let you go
