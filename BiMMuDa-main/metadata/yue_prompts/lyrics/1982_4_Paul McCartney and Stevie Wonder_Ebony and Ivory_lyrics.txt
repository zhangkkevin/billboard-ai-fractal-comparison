[Verse]
Side by side, in black and white  
Different notes but shared delight  
We play a tune both strong and clear  
Together, we bring harmony near  

[Chorus]
Ebony and ivory  
Living in perfect harmony  
On the keys of life we play  
Building bridges every day  

[Verse]
You bring the depth, I bring the shine  
But every line weaves in time  
Our voices blend, our hearts align  
In this song that’s yours and mine  

[Bridge]
Let no one split what’s meant to be  
We’re one in soul and melody  

[Outro]
Ebony and ivory  
The world could learn from you and me
