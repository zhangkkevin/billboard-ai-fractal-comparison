[Verse]
You said you loved me, then you lied  
Left my heart in pieces, pride denied  
Now I’m stuck inside this frame  
Of vengeance burning in your name  

[Chorus]
I might just kill Bill, not for thrill  
But 'cause this heartbreak won’t sit still  
I gave my soul, I played it right  
Now all I feel is endless night  

[Verse]
You moved on like I was air  
And left me drowning in despair  
I try to breathe, I try to heal  
But every scar reminds what’s real  

[Bridge]
I don't want to be this way  
But rage don’t always ask to stay  

[Outro]
So if I break, don't call it shame  
You’re the one who lit the flame
