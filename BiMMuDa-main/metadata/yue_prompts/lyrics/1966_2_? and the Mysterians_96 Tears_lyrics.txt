[Verse]
You said goodbye with a grin  
Left me where the pain begins  
Now I’m counting every sigh  
Since you kissed this love goodbye  

[Chorus]
Ninety-six tears down my face  
Since you left without a trace  
Heartbreak hangs like chandelier  
Every drop, a crystal clear  

[Verse]
I told myself I’d be strong  
But the days feel twice as long  
Tried to laugh, but truth appears  
And I’m drowning in my tears  

[Bridge]
You’ll come back when you’re alone  
But I won’t pick up that phone  

[Outro]
Ninety-six tears, still I cry  
Even love must say goodbye
