[Verse]
There’s a yellow rose in Texas  
That I long to see once more  
She waits for me by moonlight  
By that old red wooden door  

[Chorus]
She’s the sweetest girl I ever knew  
Her smile can split the storm in two  
Though I roam this world so wide  
I still see her by my side  

[Verse]
When the bugles call at dawning  
And I march with weary men  
I think of her soft singing  
And it lifts me once again  

[Bridge]
No diamond shines the way she glows  
That lovely Texas yellow rose  

[Outro]
So tell her that I’m coming home  
No more to fight, no more to roam
