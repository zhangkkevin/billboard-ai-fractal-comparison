[Verse]
Been working hard, now it's time to play  
Leave the town and run away  
Kick off your shoes, feel the ground  
Hear that beat and turn it loud  

[Chorus]
Cut loose, footloose  
Shake the chains, turn up the juice  
Let your worries hit the floor  
We ain’t holding back no more  

[Verse]
The rules are heavy, hearts are tired  
But tonight we’re re-inspired  
Raise your hands, forget the past  
This dance is gonna make it last  

[Bridge]
Let the rhythm take control  
It’s your night to bare your soul  

[Outro]
Footloose and flying free  
Come and lose yourself with me
