[Verse]
Last night I dreamed you held my hand  
We walked again along the sand  
Your voice a song I can't forget  
But you're a ghost I'm not done with yet  

[Chorus]
Goodnight Irene, but not goodbye  
You're still the tear behind my eye  
Though you may drift with stars above  
I dream of you, my only love  

[Bridge]
They say that time will heal and mend  
But dreams of you will never end  

[Outro]
So sleep, my dear, where moonlight's been  
I'll find you there, goodnight Irene
