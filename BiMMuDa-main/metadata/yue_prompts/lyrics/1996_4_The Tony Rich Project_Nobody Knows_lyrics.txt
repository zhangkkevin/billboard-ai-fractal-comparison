[Verse]
I wear a smile, I play the part  
But no one sees my broken heart  
Behind these eyes, there’s rain and flame  
A world that never feels the same  

[Chorus]
Nobody knows the tears I hide  
The battles waged deep inside  
They see the light, they miss the gray  
They never hear the words I say  

[Verse]
I laugh too loud, I joke, I shine  
But pain walks close, it mirrors mine  
I scream in silence every night  
Still holding on with all my might  

[Bridge]
If someone asked, I’d just pretend  
But I still hope that pain will end  

[Outro]
Nobody knows, but I still fight  
To make it through another night
