[Verse]
Don't leave me here with silent cries  
With shattered dreams and endless whys  
You tore the page, you closed the book  
But I still ache with every look  

[Chorus]
Un-break my heart, rewind the pain  
Bring back love like falling rain  
Undo the tears, restore the light  
Hold me again through the night  

[Verse]
Each day I wake, I feel the space  
Where once I found your warm embrace  
The nights are long, the bed is cold  
Your touch is all I want to hold  

[Bridge]
If love can fade, then it can grow  
So take me back to what we know  

[Outro]
Un-break my heart, donâ€™t let it end  
Make me believe in us again
