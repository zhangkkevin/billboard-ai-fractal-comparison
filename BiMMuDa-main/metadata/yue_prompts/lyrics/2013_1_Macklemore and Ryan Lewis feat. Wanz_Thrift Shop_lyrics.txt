[Intro]
I'm gonna pop some tags...  

[Verse]
Walkin’ through the thrift store, feelin’ like a king  
Got my fur coat on, yeah, I'm doin' my thing  
Two bucks in my pocket, watch me shine  
Style ain’t cost, it’s state of mind  

[Chorus]
I’m fresh, I’m clean, in secondhand threads  
Rockin’ old school kicks and vintage dreads  
It’s not about price, it’s how you wear it  
Thrift life, baby, don’t you dare compare it  

[Verse]
Grandpa’s sweater, grandma’s shades  
Turnin' looks, breakin’ fades  
This ain't Gucci, this ain't bling  
But I feel like royalty in everything  

[Bridge]
Who needs labels when you’ve got soul?  
Stitch it up and take control  

[Chorus]
I’m fresh, I’m clean, in secondhand threads  
Rockin’ old school kicks and vintage dreads  
It’s not about price, it’s how you wear it  
Thrift life, baby, don’t you dare compare it
