[Verse]
I gave you all, the whole of me  
Wrapped in love and harmony  
But every time you turn away  
I feel my soul begin to sway  

[Chorus]
Don’t go breaking my heart  
We’re not meant to fall apart  
Hold me close and say you’ll stay  
Don’t let this love just drift away  

[Verse]
I’m not the kind to beg or plead  
But you’re the only one I need  
We’ve come too far, we’ve seen too much  
To let it slip without a touch  

[Bridge]
I’m not asking for perfection  
Just a little true connection  

[Outro]
Don’t go breaking what we’ve made  
Don’t let the light of love fade
