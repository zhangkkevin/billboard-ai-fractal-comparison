[Verse]
You touched my heart, then walked away  
Left me bleeding words I couldn't say  
I gave you love, I played it true  
But still you cut me through and through  

[Chorus]
These foolish games you play  
Turn sunshine into gray  
I stood right here and lost the fight  
While you danced into the night  

[Verse]
You loved me with a stranger's smile  
Made me feel small all the while  
I wore your hurt like second skin  
Just hoping love would let me in  

[Bridge]
But love don’t live where lies begin  
It only hurts when you pretend  

[Outro]
These foolish games are done  
I’m walking toward the sun
