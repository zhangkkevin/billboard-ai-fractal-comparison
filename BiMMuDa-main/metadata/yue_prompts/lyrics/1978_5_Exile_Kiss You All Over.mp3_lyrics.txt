[Verse]
I see the hunger in your eyes  
Like summer heat in moonlit skies  
You draw me in, you burn me slow  
And I can’t stop, I won’t let go  

[Chorus]
I want to kiss you all over  
Till the night turns into day  
Feel your fire pull me closer  
Till the stars all drift away  

[Verse]
Each touch a spark, a wordless flame  
We move like thunder with no name  
You breathe me in, I breathe you out  
And all we are is love and doubt  

[Bridge]
In every kiss, I lose control  
But find a place that makes me whole  

[Outro]
I want to kiss you all over  
And hold you through the light
