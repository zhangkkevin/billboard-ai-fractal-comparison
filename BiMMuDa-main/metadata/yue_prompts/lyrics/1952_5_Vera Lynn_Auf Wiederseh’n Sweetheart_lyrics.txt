[Verse]
Auf wiederseh’n, my love, goodbye  
Though it hurts, I won’t ask why  
The ship is leaving with the tide  
And still I feel you by my side  

[Chorus]
Sweetheart, don’t forget our song  
Even if I’m gone too long  
Hold my memory in your sleep  
And my promise I will keep  

[Verse]
Auf wiederseh’n with tearful grace  
One last look upon your face  
Though the miles may lie between  
You're forever in my dream  

[Bridge]
Time may try to dim your name  
But I will love you just the same  

[Chorus]
Sweetheart, don’t forget our song  
Even if I’m gone too long  
Hold my memory in your sleep  
And my promise I will keep
