[Verse]
I don't need a cape or flight  
Just your hand to hold at night  
Not a legend carved in stone  
Just a heart that calls you home  

[Chorus]
I want something just like this  
Simple moments, stolen kiss  
No galaxies, no epic twist  
Just love, and something just like this  

[Verse]
They wrote stories of ancient kings  
But I find magic in little things  
No battle scars, no sword to wield  
Just a love that’s real and healed  

[Bridge]
Let them chase the stars above  
We’ll stay here and fall in love  

[Chorus]
I want something just like this  
Simple moments, stolen kiss  
No galaxies, no epic twist  
Just love, and something just like this
