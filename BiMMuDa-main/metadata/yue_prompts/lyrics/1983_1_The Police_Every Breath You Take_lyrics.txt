[Verse]
Every move you make, I feel the air  
Like shadows dancing unaware  
I trace your voice inside my head  
Through empty rooms and words unsaid  

[Chorus]
Every breath you take  
I feel the ache, I feel the break  
Even when you're miles away  
I watch the night turn into day  

[Verse]
The love we had, it lingers still  
A ghost that walks against my will  
Each step you take, I fall behind  
A prisoner of a fading mind  

[Bridge]
I reach for light in darkened space  
But only find your vanished face  

[Outro]
Every breath you take, I see  
You're always just ahead of me
