[Verse]
Be my love, and I will give  
A world in which your dreams may live  
My voice will rise, my heart will soar  
If I can be yours evermore  

[Chorus]
Be my love, don’t turn away  
Let passion bloom, let silence sway  
I’ll sing your name, I’ll call the skies  
Just to be where your heart lies  

[Bridge]
You’re the fire in my soul  
The one who makes me whole  

[Outro]
So take my hand, don’t ask why  
Be my love, until we die
