[Verse]
You walk in with that look tonight  
And I can’t help but feel the light  
You blur the lines between right and wrong  
But with you, it don’t take long  

[Chorus]
You got that blurred line, can’t define  
What’s yours, what’s yours becomes mine  
You play the game, I play it too  
But I only wanna dance with you  

[Verse]
Got that smile that pulls me in  
Your rhythm’s wild beneath your skin  
You say stop, but your body says go  
So tell me what I need to know  

[Bridge]
A little mystery’s fine by me  
Let’s write our own reality  

[Chorus]
You got that blurred line, can’t define  
What’s yours, what’s yours becomes mine  
You play the game, I play it too  
But I only wanna dance with you
