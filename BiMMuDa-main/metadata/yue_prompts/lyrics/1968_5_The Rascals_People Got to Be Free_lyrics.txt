[Verse]
Every soul deserves to shine  
To walk with love, to cross the line  
We were born to lift each other  
To see all strangers as our brother  

[Chorus]
People got to be free  
To speak, to love, to simply be  
Tear the fences, break the chains  
Let compassion guide the reins  

[Verse]
Voices rise across the land  
Asking only for a hand  
No more fear, no more divide  
We are one when love’s our guide  

[Bridge]
Freedom ain’t just for the few  
It starts with me and lives in you  

[Outro]
People got to be free  
And that begins with you and me
