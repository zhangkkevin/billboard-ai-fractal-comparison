[Verse]
There’s a fire inside my chest  
Burning brighter than the rest  
You said you'd never let me down  
But now you’re lost, and I won’t drown  

[Chorus]
We could’ve had it all  
But you built the rise just for the fall  
Now I’m dancing on the ash  
Of every promise you let crash  

[Verse]
You played me like a fragile string  
Pulled me close, then clipped my wing  
But I’ve risen, feel the heat  
Now you’re the one who tastes defeat  

[Bridge]
You’ll remember every cry  
When you feel your own goodbye  

[Chorus]
We could’ve had it all  
But you built the rise just for the fall  
Now I’m dancing on the ash  
Of every promise you let crash
