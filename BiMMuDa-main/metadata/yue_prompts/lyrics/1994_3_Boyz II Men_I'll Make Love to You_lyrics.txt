[Verse]
Candlelight and softest rain  
I’ll take away your every pain  
No need to speak, just take my hand  
I’ll show you how I understand  

[Chorus]
I’ll make love to you  
Like you’ve never known it’s true  
Hold you close, feel you near  
Whisper words you need to hear  

[Verse]
Every moment, slow and deep  
You’re the dream I want to keep  
Let’s lose the world and take our time  
Our rhythm falling into rhyme  

[Bridge]
This night’s for you, just say the word  
And I’ll give you all you’ve ever heard  

[Outro]
I’ll make love to you tonight  
Until we rise in morning light
