[Verse]
I’m just a lonely boy  
Searching for a little joy  
She left one summer afternoon  
Now I hum a broken tune  

[Chorus]
Lonely boy, cry no more  
She’s gone through that swinging door  
But the stars above still glow  
And there’s more to love to know  

[Verse]
We danced to songs on old cafés  
Now I walk through empty days  
Each echo sounds like her goodbye  
But still I look up at the sky  

[Bridge]
If she comes back, I’ll be here  
With open arms and no more fear  

[Outro]
Till then I roam with quiet grace  
Just a lonely boy in time and space
