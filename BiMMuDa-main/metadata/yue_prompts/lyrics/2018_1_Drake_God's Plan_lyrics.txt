[Verse]
I been movin' through the silence  
Tryna keep my peace from violence  
People love me, people doubt  
But only one thing I care about  

[Chorus]
God’s plan, I feel it strong  
Even when the path feels wrong  
Every loss, every gain  
It’s all part of God’s plan  

[Verse]
They said I changed, maybe I did  
But still I hustle like that kid  
Gave my heart, took the blame  
Now I walk through fire and flame  

[Bridge]
Didn’t come this far to fold  
Got my story still untold  

[Chorus]
God’s plan, I feel it strong  
Even when the path feels wrong  
Every loss, every gain  
It’s all part of God’s plan
