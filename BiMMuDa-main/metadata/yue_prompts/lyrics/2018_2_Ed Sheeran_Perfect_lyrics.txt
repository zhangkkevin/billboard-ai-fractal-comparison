[Verse]
We were just kids when we fell deep  
Now your name is all I keep  
In a song that never ends  
Where lovers grow to best of friends  

[Chorus]
You look perfect, just like now  
You take my breath, don’t ask how  
In this dance, in this light  
I found heaven in your eyes tonight  

[Verse]
Barefoot on that evening sand  
I traced your name with shaky hands  
Through the dark, you were my flame  
And I’ll never love the same  

[Bridge]
Time may fade our golden days  
But I will love you anyway  

[Chorus]
You look perfect, just like now  
You take my breath, don’t ask how  
In this dance, in this light  
I found heaven in your eyes tonight
