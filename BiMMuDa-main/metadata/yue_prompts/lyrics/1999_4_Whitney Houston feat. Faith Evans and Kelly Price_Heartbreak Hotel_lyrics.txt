[Verse]
Checked in alone with tears to spare  
Another night, another stare  
The walls remember every fight  
The silence screams you’re not alright  

[Chorus]
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel  
Where the pain and memories dwell  
Room for one with love gone wrong  
Stay the night, it won’t be long  

[Verse]
I called your name through static light  
But got no answer, just the night  
You vanished like a fleeting song  
Left me wondering all along  

[Bridge]
Down these halls, we fade, we cry  
No one asks the reason why  

[Outro]
Heartbreak Hotel, where I lay  
Till your ghost fades away
