[Verse]
Hey there, you with the lonely stare  
Talking to shadows in the air  
Why do you wait for someone gone  
When love could be right here all along?  

[Chorus]
Hey there, stop the dream  
Step away from the movie screen  
Life is real, so take the chance  
Don’t miss out on a true romance  

[Verse]
You write their name in every sigh  
While time and hope go walking by  
But someone here still sees your light  
Even when you dim it every night  

[Bridge]
The world is bigger than regret  
So take my hand—don’t forget  

[Outro]
Hey there, turn your heart around  
I’m still here, still love you now
