[Verse]
She walks in silk, she walks in flame  
And every step she takes, they call her name  
A glance, a smile, and you forget  
That danger hasn’t passed you yet  

[Chorus]
Poison, in her kiss  
A sweetness you can’t resist  
She’s the thrill that breaks your fall  
But leaves you with nothing at all  

[Verse]
You think you’ve got her figured out  
But she’s the silence in your shout  
She’s the fire behind the charm  
A warning dressed in warm  

[Bridge]
You play the game, you lose control  
She’s already claimed your soul  

[Outro]
Poison, in disguise  
A devil with angel eyes
