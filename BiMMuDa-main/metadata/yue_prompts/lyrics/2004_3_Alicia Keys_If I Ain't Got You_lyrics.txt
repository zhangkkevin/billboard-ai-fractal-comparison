[Verse]
Some people want diamonds and gold  
But I just want a hand to hold  
No fancy cars, no magazine dreams  
Just you and me, that's everything  

[Chorus]
If I ain't got you, I got nothin’ at all  
No safety net if I start to fall  
All the riches, they fade away  
If I ain't got you, I got no day  

[Verse]
The world keeps spinning fast  
But with you, I make it last  
When I'm lost, you're all I see  
You’re my home, my remedy  

[Bridge]
No one else can make me feel  
This kind of love that’s real  

[Chorus]
If I ain't got you, I got nothin’ at all  
No safety net if I start to fall  
All the riches, they fade away  
If I ain't got you, I got no day  

[Outro]
If I ain't got you
