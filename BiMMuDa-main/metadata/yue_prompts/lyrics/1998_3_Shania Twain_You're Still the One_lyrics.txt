[Verse]
They all said we wouldn’t last  
But we rose from every past  
They tried to pull us far apart  
But you stayed inside my heart  

[Chorus]
You’re still the one I dream about  
Still the one I can’t live without  
Through every trial, we found our grace  
You’re still my calm, my sacred place  

[Verse]
We walked through storms and shining skies  
And never had to wear disguise  
You’ve seen me break, seen me rise  
Still you never left my side  

[Bridge]
Years may change the shape we see  
But not what you still mean to me  

[Outro]
You’re still the one I hold each night  
Still the spark, still the light
