[Verse]
I got a feelin' tonight's the night  
We shine so bright, we own the light  
Champagne poppin', nothin’ wrong  
Everybody sing along  

[Chorus]
Tonight’s gonna be a good night  
Feelin’ like the world’s just right  
Hands up high, take the chance  
Lose yourself inside this dance  

[Verse]
Call your friends, tell them now  
We about to show 'em how  
Every moment, let it rise  
Celebrate under the skies  

[Bridge]
No more waiting, time is now  
Let’s get wild and take a bow  

[Chorus]
Tonight’s gonna be a good night  
Feelin’ like the world’s just right  
Hands up high, take the chance  
Lose yourself inside this dance  

[Outro]
Good, good night
