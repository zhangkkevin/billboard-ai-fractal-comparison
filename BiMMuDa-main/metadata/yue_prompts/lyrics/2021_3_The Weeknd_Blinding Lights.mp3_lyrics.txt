[Intro]  
I’ve been running through the shadows of my mind  
Looking for the love I left behind  

[Verse]  
Late night city calls my name  
Flashing lights and midnight games  
I’ve been chasing ghosts and signs  
But you're the one I hope to find  

[Chorus]  
I’m blinded by your light, can't sleep at night  
You’re the only thing that’s feeling right  
Neon dreams and faded lines  
Still, I need your touch in time  

[Verse]  
Every turn is just a blur  
All these nights without your words  
Your memory glows, it won’t let go  
I keep on driving through the snow  

[Bridge]  
All these streets, they feel the same  
But none of them whisper your name  

[Outro]  
Blinded by your light, I lose control  
Only you can make me whole
