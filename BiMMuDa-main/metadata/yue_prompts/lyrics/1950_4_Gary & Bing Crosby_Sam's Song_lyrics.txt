[Intro]
Hey there, Sam, play that tune...  

[Verse]
Sam’s got rhythm, Sam’s got style  
He sings his song and makes you smile  
With brother Bing he harmonized  
A little jazz, some sweet surprise  

[Chorus]
It’s Sam’s song, a melody  
That bounces like a summer breeze  
You tap your toes and clap along  
To the simple joy of Sam’s song  

[Bridge]
In every bar, in every beat  
He makes our day feel so complete  

[Outro]
So thanks to Sam, we’ll sing tonight  
With hearts aglow and voices light
