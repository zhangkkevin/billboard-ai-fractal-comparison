[Verse]
I used to stand against the wall  
Too shy to dance, too scared to fall  
But then the band began to play  
And funk just swept my fear away  

[Chorus]
Play that funky music, loud and proud  
Let it shake up every crowd  
Get down with rhythm, lose control  
Let that funky beat rock your soul  

[Verse]
The bass was low, the groove was tight  
I found my fire, I found my light  
Now I don’t care what others see  
This funky sound is setting me free  

[Bridge]
Every note a liberation  
Pure, unfiltered celebration  

[Outro]
Play that funky music, all night long  
We’ll keep grooving till the dawn
