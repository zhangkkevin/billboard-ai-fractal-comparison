[Intro]
Go shorty, it's your birthday  
We gon' party like it's your birthday  

[Verse]
You see me in the club, bottle full of bub  
Got my crew tight, posted, we don’t budge  
I ain't here for drama, I'm here for fun  
Throw your hands up ‘til the night is done  

[Chorus]
We in the club, and we gettin' live  
Turn it up, feel that vibe  
Every city, every side  
We ride, we shine, we survive  

[Verse]
You see the lights, I see the fame  
But I'm still the same, still in the game  
From the gutter to the charts  
Still breaking hearts, still playing smart  

[Bridge]
Hands up high, we don't stop  
Every night, we rise to the top  

[Chorus]
We in the club, and we gettin' live  
Turn it up, feel that vibe  
Every city, every side  
We ride, we shine, we survive  

[Outro]
It’s your birthday
