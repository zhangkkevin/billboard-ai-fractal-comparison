[Verse]
City glows in red and blue  
But all I see, all I want is you  
These empty streets are full of sound  
And every echo pulls me down  

[Chorus]
I’m blinded by the lights  
Can’t sleep ‘til I’m in your sights  
Running fast through neon dreams  
You’re the calm behind the screams  

[Verse]
The night reflects my every fear  
But I still chase you, crystal clear  
Speeding past the midnight signs  
All I need is you this time  

[Bridge]
Your touch, the only truth I know  
A guiding pulse in every glow  

[Chorus]
I’m blinded by the lights  
Can’t sleep ‘til I’m in your sights  
Running fast through neon dreams  
You’re the calm behind the screams
