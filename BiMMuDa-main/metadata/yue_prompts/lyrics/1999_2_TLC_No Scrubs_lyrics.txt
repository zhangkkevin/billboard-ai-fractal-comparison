[Verse]
You roll up, but you ain’t real  
Flashing talk like it’s a deal  
But I see through your empty game  
You’ve got style, but not a name  

[Chorus]
No scrubs, no rides for free  
I need someone who’s there for me  
Not a boy who stays behind  
But a man who shows his mind  

[Verse]
You hang around with borrowed shine  
But you can’t even match my line  
I'm not here for sweet disguise  
I want truth behind the eyes  

[Bridge]
You want love? Start with pride  
Not with lies you try to hide  

[Outro]
No scrubs, just move along  
I know my worth—I’m standing strong
