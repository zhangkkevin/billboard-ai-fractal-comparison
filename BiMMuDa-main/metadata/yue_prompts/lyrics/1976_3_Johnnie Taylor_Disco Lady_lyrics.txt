[Verse]
She walks into the lighted floor  
The crowd canâ€™t help but want some more  
She spins like fire in silver shoes  
And every heartbeat finds its cues  

[Chorus]
Disco lady, shine so bright  
You're the rhythm of the night  
Move your body, feel the groove  
Make the whole wide dance floor move  

[Verse]
With every sway, she casts a spell  
No one moves the way she dwells  
Glitter falling from her hair  
She floats like magic through the air  

[Bridge]
Underneath the flashing beams  
She turns our dreams into routines  

[Outro]
Disco lady, never slow  
Take us where we need to go
