[Verse]
Mona Lisa, eyes so deep  
Tell me secrets that you keep  
You wear that smile so full of grace  
But shadows linger on your face  

[Chorus]
Are you real or just a dream?  
A silent voice behind the gleam  
Mona Lisa, tell me true  
Is there someone loving you?  

[Bridge]
Every line, a mystery  
Painted soft in secrecy  

[Outro]
Mona Lisa, still and bright  
Stay with me another night
