[Verse]  
There’s a calm in your eyes, a light so rare  
Like a song I forgot was always there  
When you walk in the room, the world takes note  
Every heart begins to float  

[Chorus]  
There’s something about the way you look tonight  
Like a fire that turns the dark to light  
It’s not just beauty, it’s something more  
You open windows, you unlock doors  

[Verse]  
The stars get quiet when you smile  
You make the moment worth the while  
I can’t explain what makes it true  
But everything is right with you  

[Bridge]  
You don’t even know the spell you cast  
But time stands still when you walk past  

[Outro]  
Yeah, something about the way you look tonight  
Takes my breath and makes it right
