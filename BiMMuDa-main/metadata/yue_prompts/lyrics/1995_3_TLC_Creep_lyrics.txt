[Verse]
I keep it cool, I play it low  
But deep inside, I need to know  
If you’re with me, or just pretend  
I can't keep playing, let's not pretend  

[Chorus]
So I creep, just to see  
What’s behind your secrecy  
You say you love me, but I doubt  
When silence speaks louder than shout  

[Verse]
You stay out late, you dodge my gaze  
But I still hope it’s just a phase  
I tell myself it’s all in my head  
But I replay every word you said  

[Bridge]
Loving you should make me rise  
Not question truth behind your eyes  

[Outro]
So I creep, because I fear  
That love’s not really here
