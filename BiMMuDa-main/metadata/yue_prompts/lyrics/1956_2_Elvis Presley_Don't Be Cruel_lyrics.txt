[Verse]
You got that look, you twist your lips  
You leave me hangin’ on the flips  
But baby, I’m not here for games  
Say you love me, don’t bring shame  

[Chorus]
Don’t be cruel to a heart so true  
Darlin’, I’m in love with you  
We’ve come so far, don’t push away  
Say you’ll stay, just one more day  

[Verse]
I ain’t perfect, made mistakes  
But I still give more than I take  
So don’t pretend you’re made of stone  
I need your warmth, not cold alone  

[Bridge]
This love’s a flame, don’t let it die  
You and I, we still could fly  

[Outro]
So take my hand and make it right  
Don’t be cruel tonight
