[Intro]
I don’t need a world of gold  
Just your hand when nights are cold  

[Verse]
If you gave your heart to me  
I’d be the light you’d always see  
Through every high, through every low  
I'd be the one who’d never go  

[Chorus]
I just want to be your everything  
Your sunrise, your song to sing  
When the world feels far and wide  
I'll be the one right by your side  

[Verse]
No treasure shines like your smile  
You make this life feel so worthwhile  
With every beat, my heart will show  
I’m loving you more than you know  

[Bridge]
You’re the dream I never planned  
Now I’m reaching for your hand  

[Outro]
I just want to be your everything  
Forever more, through everything
