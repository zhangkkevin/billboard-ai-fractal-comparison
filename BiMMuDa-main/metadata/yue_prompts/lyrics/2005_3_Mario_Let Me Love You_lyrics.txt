[Verse]
You’ve been hurt, I see the pain  
I swear I’ll never treat you the same  
He left you broken, full of doubt  
Let me show you what love’s about  

[Chorus]
Let me love you like you need  
Hold you close, help you believe  
You’re a diamond, you deserve  
Every kiss and every word  

[Verse]
He never saw what I can see  
The strength and beauty inside of thee  
If you let go, trust in me  
I’ll be the man you thought he’d be  

[Bridge]
You don’t have to cry alone  
I’ll be the place you call home  

[Chorus]
Let me love you like you need  
Hold you close, help you believe  
You’re a diamond, you deserve  
Every kiss and every word  

[Outro]
Let me love you
