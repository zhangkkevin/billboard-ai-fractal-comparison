[Verse]
American woman, don’t come knockin’  
I’m done with your chains and talkin’  
Your polished smile, your plastic pride  
Don’t fit the rebel that I hide  

[Chorus]
American woman, get away from me  
Let me be wild and let me be free  
You want control, but I won’t stay  
I’ve found my soul and walked away  

[Verse]
You dress in red, white, and gold  
But underneath, your heart feels cold  
You sell me dreams you never keep  
I’m waking now, I won’t sleep  

[Bridge]
I need the fire, not the mask  
Someone real, that’s all I ask  

[Outro]
American woman, I’m movin’ on  
The fight inside me's never gone
