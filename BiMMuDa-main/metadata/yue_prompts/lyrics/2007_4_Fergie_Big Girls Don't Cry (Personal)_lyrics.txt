[Verse]
We had our moment, now it’s past  
I thought our love would always last  
But now I see I must let go  
To find myself and let you know  

[Chorus]
Big girls don’t cry, they just breathe  
They learn to love and then they leave  
I need the time to find what’s true  
And maybe someday, so will you  

[Verse]
I walk alone but not in pain  
This solitude becomes my gain  
You taught me how to stand again  
But this is where the road must end  

[Bridge]
I’ll miss your voice, I’ll miss your smile  
But I need to be alone awhile  

[Chorus]
Big girls don’t cry, they just breathe  
They learn to love and then they leave  
I need the time to find what’s true  
And maybe someday, so will you  

[Outro]
Big girls don’t cry
