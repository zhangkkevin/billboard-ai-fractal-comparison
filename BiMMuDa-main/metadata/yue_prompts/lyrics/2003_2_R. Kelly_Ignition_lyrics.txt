[Intro]
Now, usually I don't do this...  

[Verse]
It’s the weekend, and I’m feelin’ right  
Got the keys to the city, we rollin’ tonight  
The DJ’s bumpin’ that old school sound  
We in the zone, just layin’ it down  

[Chorus]
This is the remix to ignition  
Hot and fresh out the kitchen  
Got every girl in here wishin’  
Feelin’ fly, no permission  

[Verse]
Cris in the cup, body movin’ slow  
Drop top cruisin’ where the lovers go  
It’s a celebration, call your crew  
‘Cause everything’s better when I’m with you  

[Bridge]
Bounce, bounce, feel that beat  
Move those hips, don't miss a beat  

[Chorus]
This is the remix to ignition  
Hot and fresh out the kitchen  
Got every girl in here wishin’  
Feelin’ fly, no permission  

[Outro]
Let it roll
