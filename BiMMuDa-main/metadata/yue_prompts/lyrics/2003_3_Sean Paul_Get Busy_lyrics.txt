[Intro]
Yo, shake that ting!  

[Verse]
Gal on the floor, feel the beat in your chest  
Move to the rhythm, put your body to the test  
Sean da Paul in the place tonight  
Turn up the heat, we a mash it right  

[Chorus]
Get busy, don't stop  
Wine to the rhythm, let your body pop  
Hands to the sky, feet on the floor  
Move like you never moved before  

[Verse]
Bassline heavy, make you lose control  
Dance so hot, got you feelinâ€™ bold  
No need to talk, just feel the jam  
Sway to the beat, gyal, here I am  

[Bridge]
Left to the right, to the center again  
One more time, now do it again  

[Chorus]
Get busy, don't stop  
Wine to the rhythm, let your body pop  
Hands to the sky, feet on the floor  
Move like you never moved before
