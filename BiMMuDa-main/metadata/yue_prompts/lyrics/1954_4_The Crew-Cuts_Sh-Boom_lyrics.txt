[Intro]
Sh-boom, sh-boom, life could be a dream...  

[Verse]
If I could take you to the moon  
We’d sing beneath a doo-wop tune  
You smile and suddenly I know  
That this could be love, fo’ sho’  

[Chorus]
Sh-boom, my heart goes wild  
You’re like candy, sweet and styled  
If I wake up and you’re mine  
Life could be a dream divine  

[Verse]
Pop the top on a soda float  
Your name’s the tune my jukebox wrote  
Let’s take a ride, just you and me  
Down the lane of harmony  

[Bridge]
I never thought I’d fall so quick  
But with you, I found the trick  

[Outro]
Sh-boom, sh-boom, just say you will  
Life could be a dream come real
