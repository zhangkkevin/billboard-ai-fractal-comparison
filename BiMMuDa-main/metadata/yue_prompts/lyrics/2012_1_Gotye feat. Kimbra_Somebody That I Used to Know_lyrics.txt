[Verse]
We used to talk 'til the sun would rise  
Shared all our fears, never wore disguise  
Now your voice is just an echo in my head  
You turned away, and all you said...  

[Chorus]
You're somebody that I used to know  
A stranger in the afterglow  
You vanished in the words you spoke  
Now I just breathe through all the smoke  

[Verse]
We built our world on fragile dreams  
Now I walk alone through broken themes  
You closed the door, I lost the key  
And now you’re just a memory  

[Bridge]
I reach for ghosts in every sound  
But nothing’s left, not even ground  

[Chorus]
You're somebody that I used to know  
A stranger in the afterglow  
You vanished in the words you spoke  
Now I just breathe through all the smoke
