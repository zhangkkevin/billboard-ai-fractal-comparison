[Verse]
She walks the edge, afraid to fall  
But chasing dreams beyond the wall  
She’s reaching out for something more  
But can’t unlock the broken door  

[Chorus]
Don’t go chasing waterfalls  
Stick to the rivers and the calls  
That guide you home, that bring you peace  
Don’t trade your truth for a release  

[Verse]
He runs the night with hungry eyes  
But never sees the morning rise  
He’s lost in fog, in search of flame  
But can’t remember his own name  

[Bridge]
The current pulls you far and wide  
But still the truth is deep inside  

[Outro]
Don’t go chasing what won’t stay  
Find the light and walk your way
