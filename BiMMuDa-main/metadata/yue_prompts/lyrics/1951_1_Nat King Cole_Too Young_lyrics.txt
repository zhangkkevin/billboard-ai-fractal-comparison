[Verse]
They say we’re just too young to know  
What love is like or how it grows  
But every time I see your eyes  
I feel a truth that never lies  

[Chorus]
Too young to plan, too young to say  
But I still dream of us one day  
We may be small in others’ eyes  
But love like this will never die  

[Bridge]
We’ll prove them wrong with every kiss  
Young or not, we know what this is  

[Outro]
So hold me close, don’t let it end  
You’re more than love—you’re my best friend
