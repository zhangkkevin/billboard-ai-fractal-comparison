[Verse]
I used to drift without a way  
But you brought light into my day  
You showed me love I’d never known  
And now I never feel alone  

[Chorus]
Angel of mine, you came to me  
Like sunlight breaking through the sea  
With every touch, you helped me grow  
And gave me strength I didn’t know  

[Verse]
Your eyes remind me what is real  
Your love’s the peace I always feel  
You lifted me when I was down  
And placed a halo on my crown  

[Bridge]
You are the wish I didn’t send  
The story with the perfect end  

[Outro]
Angel of mine, don’t fly away  
You’re the reason that I pray
