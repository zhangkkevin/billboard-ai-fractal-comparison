[Verse]
I thought love was just pretend  
A broken road that wouldn’t mend  
But then you came, and now I see  
There’s more to life than fantasy  

[Chorus]
I’m a believer, now I know  
Your love can make my spirit grow  
No more doubts, no more lies  
You put the starlight in my skies  

[Verse]
I used to laugh when lovers sighed  
But you unlocked what I denied  
With every word and every kiss  
You showed me what true magic is  

[Bridge]
Now I’m the fool who sings out loud  
Head held high and heart so proud  

[Outro]
I’m a believer, yes it’s true  
And it’s all because of you
