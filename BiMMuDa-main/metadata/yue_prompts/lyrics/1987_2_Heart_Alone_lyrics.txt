[Verse]
I hear your name in empty space  
In dreams, I still see your face  
But every night, the silence grows  
And I’m the only one who knows  

[Chorus]
How do I get you alone?  
When all I have is this dial tone  
The world feels cold, and I can't see  
Why you’re not here with me  

[Verse]
I held my breath, I took the fall  
But you were never there at all  
Now every light feels far away  
And I’m still stuck in yesterday  

[Bridge]
If only you could hear me cry  
If only hearts could justify  

[Outro]
How do I reach what’s already gone?  
How do I keep holding on?
