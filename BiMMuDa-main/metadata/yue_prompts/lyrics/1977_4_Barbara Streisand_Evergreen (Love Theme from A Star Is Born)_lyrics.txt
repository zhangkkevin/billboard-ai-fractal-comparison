[Verse]
Love is soft as petals fall  
A whisper strong, yet standing tall  
It takes no shape, it speaks no word  
But in your gaze, it’s always heard  

[Chorus]
Evergreen, this love of ours  
Through darkest nights and blooming hours  
It never fades, it never fears  
It grows through time, through joy and tears  

[Verse]
We don’t need the stars to shine  
Your voice is more than any sign  
With every look, with every breath  
You bring me life, you silence death  

[Bridge]
Hearts may break and seasons end  
But we remain, like sky and wind  

[Outro]
Evergreen, and ever true  
This love will always lead me to you
