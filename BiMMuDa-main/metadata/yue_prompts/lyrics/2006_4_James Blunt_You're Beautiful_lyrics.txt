[Verse]
She walked past me, lost in her mind  
A perfect picture, frozen in time  
I smiled, she didn’t see  
But for a moment, she belonged to me  

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, so unaware  
Like a star that doesn’t care  
I won’t forget, I never do  
The way the light danced off of you  

[Verse]
I held my breath, she disappeared  
And left me drowning in my fear  
She’s gone, I know, but still I see  
That perfect girl who passed by me  

[Bridge]
And though we’ll never share a word  
That silence is the sweetest heard  

[Chorus]
You're beautiful, so unaware  
Like a star that doesn’t care  
I won’t forget, I never do  
The way the light danced off of you  

[Outro]
You're beautiful
