[Verse]
We danced too close, we moved too fast  
Never thought this joy would pass  
But secrets whispered through the night  
Have turned our love from dark to light  

[Chorus]
I’m never gonna dance again  
Guilty feet have lost their rhythm  
Though it's easy to pretend  
I know you're not a fool  

[Verse]
Should’ve known better, should’ve stayed true  
Now all that’s left are shades of you  
The music fades, the lights go cold  
A story broken, never told  

[Bridge]
If I could turn back what I said  
I'd dance with you instead  

[Outro]
I’m never gonna dance again  
These silent steps won’t lead to mend
