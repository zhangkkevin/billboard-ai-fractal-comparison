[Verse]
You touch my skin, the world ignites  
Your love like fire in cold nights  
Every kiss, a thunder roll  
You take my breath, you take control  

[Chorus]
You give me shivers, down my spine  
Every look, a spark divine  
I can’t stop this endless high  
You’re the heat I can’t deny  

[Verse]
We don’t sleep, we don’t slow  
This kind of love don’t fade, it glows  
From every laugh to every fight  
I’m still yours every night  

[Bridge]
When you’re gone, I feel the chill  
Only you can break the still  

[Chorus]
You give me shivers, down my spine  
Every look, a spark divine  
I can’t stop this endless high  
You’re the heat I can’t deny
