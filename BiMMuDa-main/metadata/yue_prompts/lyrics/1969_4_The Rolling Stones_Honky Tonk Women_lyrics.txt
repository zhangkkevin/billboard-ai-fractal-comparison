[Verse]
She walked in with boots and grace  
Whiskey smile, a wild pace  
Said she came from Baton Rouge  
And lit the bar like neon fuse  

[Chorus]
Honky tonk women, play it loud  
They own the night, they draw a crowd  
With a laugh and a look so bold  
They’ll steal your heart and leave you cold  

[Verse]
She took my hand, said let’s get lost  
No time to think, just pay the cost  
She danced me out past closing time  
And left me stranded with no sign  

[Bridge]
You can’t hold a woman like that  
She’s a storm in a cowboy hat  

[Outro]
Honky tonk women, come and go  
But they burn you down just so you know
