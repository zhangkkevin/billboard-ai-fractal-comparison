[Verse]
How do you fix what you can't see?
A soul undone, a quiet plea
I watch the world just spin around
While I can’t lift from off the ground

[Chorus]
How can you mend a broken heart?
When love is gone, where do you start?
The pieces don’t fit like they used to
And I’m left wondering what to do

[Verse]
The laughter echoes from before
But now it hurts me even more
You walked away, I stayed behind
With nothing left but silent time

[Bridge]
I reach for you in every dream
But wake to silence in between

[Outro]
How can you mend a heart like mine?
When healing needs more than time
