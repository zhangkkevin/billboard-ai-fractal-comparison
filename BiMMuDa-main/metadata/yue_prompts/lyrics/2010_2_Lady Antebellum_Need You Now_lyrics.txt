[Verse]
It’s a quarter after one, I’m all alone  
Staring at my phone, hoping you’d call home  
We said goodbye, but I can’t pretend  
That I don’t miss you again and again  

[Chorus]
I need you now, more than I knew  
Lonely silence, thinkin’ of you  
It’s reckless, yeah, it’s not wise  
But I need you now, no alibis  

[Verse]
I told myself to walk away  
But your memory begs to stay  
Every song pulls you near  
Even when you're not here  

[Bridge]
If I could go back, I just might  
Just to feel your arms tonight  

[Chorus]
I need you now, more than I knew  
Lonely silence, thinkin’ of you  
It’s reckless, yeah, it’s not wise  
But I need you now, no alibis
