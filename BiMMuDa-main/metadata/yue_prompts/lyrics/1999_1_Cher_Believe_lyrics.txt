[Verse]
No one told me it’d be this hard  
Picking pieces from the shards  
But in the silence, I found grace  
And learned to face my own embrace  

[Chorus]
Do you believe in life after love?  
When all that’s left is not enough  
Still I rise and take the fall  
Even when I lose it all  

[Verse]
I cried a sea, I screamed the night  
But now I walk into the light  
It hurt to let the past just fade  
But I'm stronger than the pain it made  

[Bridge]
Time won’t wait for me to grieve  
So I learn to just believe  

[Outro]
I believe in love again  
Even when I don’t know when
