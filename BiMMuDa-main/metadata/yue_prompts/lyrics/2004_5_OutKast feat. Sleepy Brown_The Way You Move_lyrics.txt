[Intro]
Boom, boom... bounce with it now  

[Verse]
Shorty got a style that’s so divine  
Movin' to the rhythm, she don’t waste time  
Every step, every sway  
She take your breath and dance away  

[Chorus]
I like the way you move  
Smooth like honey, right on cue  
You don’t need to prove  
You a queen and the floor is for you  

[Verse]
You got me starin’, caught in your trance  
All eyes follow when you dance  
No one else can touch your flow  
You the main event, just so you know  

[Bridge]
And when that bass hits deep  
You make the whole world skip a beat  

[Chorus]
I like the way you move  
Smooth like honey, right on cue  
You don’t need to prove  
You a queen and the floor is for you  

[Outro]
Yeah, just the way you move
