[Verse]
Roses are red, violets are blue  
My heart wrote this just for you  
In every petal, there’s a line  
Of how I wish that you were mine  

[Chorus]
Roses are red, so is my heart  
Bleeding love since we’ve been apart  
You may forget, but I won’t change  
My love remains through joy and pain  

[Verse]
You sent a note, cold and brief  
But still I hold on to belief  
That one day soon, your love will bloom  
And fill the space inside my room  

[Bridge]
I fold the paper, read it twice  
Every word cuts like ice  

[Outro]
Roses are red, and so am I  
For loving you without goodbye
