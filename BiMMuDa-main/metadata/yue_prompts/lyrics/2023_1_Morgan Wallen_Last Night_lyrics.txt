[Verse]
Last night we said too much  
Words that turned our hearts to dust  
Now I'm scrolling through regret  
Wishing I could just forget  

[Chorus]
Last night, it all came down  
We burned the bridge, we watched it drown  
I still hear your echo cry  
In the silence where we lie  

[Verse]
The drinks were loud, the anger quick  
We turned love into a trick  
You slammed the door, I watched you go  
Now I'm here with what I know  

[Bridge]
If I could rewind the fight  
Would we make it right?  

[Outro]
Last night may haunt me still  
But love donâ€™t bend to will
