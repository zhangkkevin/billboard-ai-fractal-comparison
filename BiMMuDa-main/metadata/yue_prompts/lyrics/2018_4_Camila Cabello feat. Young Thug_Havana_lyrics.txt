[Verse]
Havana nights, so warm and wild  
Your whisper sweet, your eyes beguiled  
You pulled me close, I couldn’t stay  
Now half my heart’s still far away  

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na  
You stole my heart, then ran so far  
I left my soul under your star  
Havana, that’s where you are  

[Verse]
We danced until the morning light  
You vanished deep into the night  
Now every step and every song  
Reminds me where I don’t belong  

[Bridge]
I tried to leave, but still I know  
You’re the rhythm in my soul  

[Chorus]
Havana, ooh na-na  
You stole my heart, then ran so far  
I left my soul under your star  
Havana, that’s where you are
