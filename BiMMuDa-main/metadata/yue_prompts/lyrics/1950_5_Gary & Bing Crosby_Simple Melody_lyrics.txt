[Verse]
I don’t want fancy harmony  
Just give me something sweet and free  
Two lines that dance and twirl and play  
In that old-fashioned kind of way  

[Chorus]
A simple melody, that’s all I need  
No fancy chords or lightning speed  
Just notes that hum, like morning sun  
And voices twined ‘til day is done  

[Bridge]
Let the rhythm rise and fall  
With every heart that hears the call  

[Outro]
So sing it soft or play it loud  
That simple tune still draws a crowd
