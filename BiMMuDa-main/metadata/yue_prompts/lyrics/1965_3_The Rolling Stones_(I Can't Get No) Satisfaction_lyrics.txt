[Intro]  
I can’t make no…  
No connection  

[Verse]  
I turn the dial, I hear the noise  
Selling lies to all the boys  
They talk so slick, they sell the dream  
But nothing’s ever what it seems  

[Chorus]  
I can’t make no… no connection  
I can’t fake no… true affection  
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try  
But I can’t make no  
I can’t make no connection  

[Verse]  
I walk the street, they pass me by  
With empty smiles and plastic eyes  
They say “be cool, just play the game”  
But I don’t want to look the same  

[Chorus]  
I can’t make no… no connection  
I can’t shake no… disaffection  
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try  
But I can’t make no  
I can’t make no connection  

[Bridge]  
They keep on telling me  
What I should feel and be  
But I got questions they can’t fix  
Just more rules and dirty tricks  

[Verse]  
I write my name in city smoke  
But truth’s just some kind of joke  
I scream it loud into the air  
Still no one knows I’m even there  

[Chorus]  
I can’t make no… no connection  
I can’t break no… misdirection  
And I try, and I try, and I try, and I try  
But I can’t make no  
No connection
