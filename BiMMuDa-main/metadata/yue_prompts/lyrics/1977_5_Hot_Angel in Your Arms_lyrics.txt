[Verse]
You thought I'd wait while you were gone  
But darling, I’m not made of stone  
While you were out, I found a hand  
That held me like you never planned  

[Chorus]
The angel in your arms last night  
Was somewhere else out of your sight  
You played with fire, now feel the flame  
Your angel’s learned to play the game  

[Verse]
I cried alone too many days  
Watched love just slowly slip away  
But now I know what I deserve  
And someone gave me every word  

[Bridge]
You taught me how to walk away  
So don’t act shocked I didn’t stay  

[Outro]
The angel in your arms is gone  
But I’m still dancing, moving on
