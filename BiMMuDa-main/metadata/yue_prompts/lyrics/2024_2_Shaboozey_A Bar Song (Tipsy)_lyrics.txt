[Verse]
Wired in, hearts on screen  
You said you’d stay through every scene  
But now the signal’s running cold  
This virtual heart’s been sold  

[Chorus]
Digital love, we broke the code  
Played the game, then overload  
Now I’m scrolling through the past  
Looking for a love that couldn’t last  

[Verse]
Emojis don’t replace the touch  
You said forever, but not much  
In every ping, I felt your ghost  
Now it’s silence I fear the most  

[Bridge]
Unplugged my soul just to feel real  
But now I’m numb, forget to heal  

[Chorus]
Digital love, we broke the code  
Played the game, then overload  
Now I’m scrolling through the past  
Looking for a love that couldn’t last
