[Verse]
They said I’d never make it big  
Now I’m pullin’ up in custom whips  
Lookin’ clean, talkin’ slick  
Countin’ wins with every click  

[Chorus]
Wow, yeah, that’s me  
Made a fortune out of grief  
All those nights they laughed and bowed  
Now they stand and scream out loud  

[Verse]
Diamonds flash but I don’t slow  
Still the kid from way below  
Every check a work of art  
Got my hustle set apart  

[Bridge]
What they doubted, now they cheer  
Funny how I made it here  

[Chorus]
Wow, yeah, that’s me  
Made a fortune out of grief  
All those nights they laughed and bowed  
Now they stand and scream out loud
