[Verse]
I see the way you look at me  
A quiet spark, a mystery  
You don’t know what you do inside  
You turn the tide, I can't hide  

[Chorus]
Girl, I wanna shake you down  
Break the silence, lose this frown  
Let my hands say what I mean  
You’re the center of this dream  

[Verse]
Let me love you sweet and slow  
Show you things you didn’t know  
No more games or alibis  
I want the truth behind your eyes  

[Bridge]
No need to be afraid to fall  
I’ll be there to catch it all  

[Outro]
Girl, I wanna shake you down  
Let me love you all around
