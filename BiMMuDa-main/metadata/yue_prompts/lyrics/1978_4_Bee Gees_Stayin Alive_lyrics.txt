[Verse]
Woke up with the city in my chest  
Dodging trouble, trying to do my best  
They knock me down, but I don’t fall  
Got rhythm running through it all  

[Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah, stayin’ alive  
In a world that cuts like a knife  
Through the fire, I survive  
With every step, I come alive  

[Verse]
The street’s a jungle, no disguise  
But I can see it in my eyes  
That I was made to take the heat  
And keep on movin’ to the beat  

[Bridge]
You can't stop a soul on fire  
When it's rising, climbing higher  

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah, stayin’ alive  
I’m the reason dreams revive
