[Verse]
They try to block me, close the gate  
But I just elevate, escape  
I've got a fire that won’t quit  
Each setback fuels the grit  

[Chorus]
Can’t nobody hold me down  
I rise from underground  
They can doubt, they can hate  
But I create my fate  

[Verse]
They whisper lies, they spread the shade  
But I’m built from what they made  
Every fall just proves my flight  
I bring the storm into the night  

[Bridge]
I keep on moving, I won’t stall  
Even with my back to the wall  

[Outro]
Can’t nobody dim my flame  
I was born to own this game
