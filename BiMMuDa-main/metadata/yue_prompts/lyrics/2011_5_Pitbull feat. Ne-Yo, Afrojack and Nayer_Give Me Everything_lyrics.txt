[Verse]
Tonight’s the night, no looking back  
We’re chasing stars down every track  
One chance to dance, one chance to feel  
We live this moment ‘cause it’s real  

[Chorus]
Give me everything tonight  
Your love, your fire, your neon light  
Let’s not wait, just make it true  
Give me everything, just me and you  

[Verse]
From city streets to velvet skies  
We own the night, no need for lies  
Let the beat take us there  
No tomorrow, we don’t care  

[Bridge]
Every second is a gift  
Let the music make us lift  

[Chorus]
Give me everything tonight  
Your love, your fire, your neon light  
Let’s not wait, just make it true  
Give me everything, just me and you
