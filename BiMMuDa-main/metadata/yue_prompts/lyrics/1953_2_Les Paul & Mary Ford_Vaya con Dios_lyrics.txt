[Verse]
Now the night has come to call  
Stars above begin to fall  
Though we part, my heart is near  
Whispering words you long to hear  

[Chorus]
Vaya con Dios, my love so true  
May the angels walk with you  
Though you're gone, I still remain  
Till we meet and love again  

[Bridge]
Every prayer, every sigh  
Carries my love through the sky  

[Outro]
Vaya con Dios, though weâ€™re apart  
You will always have my heart
