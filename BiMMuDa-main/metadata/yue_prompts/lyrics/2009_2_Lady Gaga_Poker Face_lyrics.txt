[Verse]
I wear a mask, I play the part  
I hide the truth, protect my heart  
You think you know what I intend  
But love and lies can twist and bend  

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my  
No you can't read my poker face  
Behind the glance, I stay composed  
You’ll never know the hand I chose  

[Verse]
I dance alone inside this game  
You chase the thrill, I light the flame  
I bet it all, you call my bluff  
But mystery is just enough  

[Bridge]
In every glance, a secret lies  
You see the surface, not inside  

[Chorus]
Can't read my, can't read my  
No you can't read my poker face  
Behind the glance, I stay composed  
You’ll never know the hand I chose
