[Intro]
Peace up, A-Town down  
Yeah!  

[Verse]
Walked in the club, spotlight on me  
Fresh kicks, clean shirt, VIP  
She movin’ slow, I feel that heat  
Bass so loud, can’t feel my feet  

[Chorus]
Yeah! Shawty got the thing I like  
Yeah! Dancin’ in the neon light  
Yeah! Don’t stop now, take it there  
Yeah! Lose control, I don’t care  

[Verse]
Bottle in hand, rhythm on repeat  
She knows the game, movin’ to the beat  
Lean in close, whisper in my ear  
Said she only came 'cause she knew I’d be here  

[Bridge]
We grindin' slow, it’s gettin' tight  
This the kind of night that feels so right  

[Chorus]
Yeah! Shawty got the thing I like  
Yeah! Dancin’ in the neon light  
Yeah! Don’t stop now, take it there  
Yeah! Lose control, I don’t care  

[Outro]
Yeah! Yeah! Let’s go!
