[Verse]
Don’t judge me for the one before
She closed her heart, then slammed the door
But I ain’t her, I’m standing true
I’d never put that hurt on you

[Chorus]
One bad apple don’t spoil the tree
Take a chance and fall with me
I’ve got love, not games to play
So let’s start fresh today

[Verse]
You look away like you’ve been burned
Afraid to trust, too much you’ve learned
But I’ve got patience, I’ve got time
To prove to you this heart is mine

[Bridge]
You’ve got bruises, I’ve got grace
Let me bring a sweeter taste

[Outro]
One bad apple came and went
But I’m the one who’s heaven-sent
