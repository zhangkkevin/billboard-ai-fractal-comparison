[Verse]
You got me spinning in your light  
Every smile, it feels so right  
You pull me in, then fade away  
Don't leave me hanging one more day  

[Chorus]
Wake me up before you go-go  
Don’t leave me dancing solo  
You’re my beat, my favorite song  
Without you here, the night feels wrong  

[Verse]
You bring the sunshine to my shoes  
Without you, baby, I just lose  
We light up like a neon glow  
So don’t you leave without hello  

[Bridge]
Take me with you, don’t be shy  
I wanna laugh until we fly  

[Outro]
Wake me up, don’t say goodbye  
Let’s dance beneath the morning sky
