[Intro]
Yeah, baby, it’s real  
Uh-huh, J to the L-O, R-U-L-E  

[Verse]
You see me walkin’ through the light  
No disguise, I’m what’s right  
Got no secrets, got no lies  
I’m the truth in all your nights  

[Chorus]
I’m real, I don’t play pretend  
What you see is what I send  
Keep it solid, thick and true  
Boy, you know I ride for you  

[Verse]
From the block and still I shine  
Chasin’ dreams and keepin’ mine  
Loyal heart and heavy style  
Watch me rise and make you smile  

[Bridge]
We’re the fire, never fake  
This is love, no heartbreak  

[Chorus]
I’m real, I don’t play pretend  
What you see is what I send  
Keep it solid, thick and true  
Boy, you know I ride for you  

[Outro]
I’m real, so real, and I do it all for you
