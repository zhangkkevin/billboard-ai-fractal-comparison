[Verse]
Raindrops keep fallin’ on my head  
But that don’t mean my soul is filled with dread  
The sky can pour, but I’ll still sing  
‘Cause life’s a funny little thing  

[Chorus]
Raindrops keep fallin’, but I smile  
They won’t last, just wait awhile  
No use complainin’ when skies are gray  
The sun will find another way  

[Verse]
I used to fear the thunder's sound  
But now I dance on soggy ground  
Each drop’s a tune, a beat, a breeze  
That shakes me loose and sets me free  

[Bridge]
Storms may visit, winds may sigh  
But I won’t let ‘em dim my sky  

[Outro]
Raindrops fall, but I won’t cry  
There’s a rainbow hangin’ high
