[Verse]
It’s been a long time coming  
But I know this heart ain’t running  
I gave you all of me, we tried  
Now it’s time we say goodbye  

[Chorus]
Let it burn, let it fade  
All the love that we made  
If I hold on, it’ll only hurt  
Time to let it burn  

[Verse]
We said forever, now it's ash  
Love’s a flame, and we burned too fast  
No regrets, no turning back  
But it’s time to face the facts  

[Bridge]
I’ll cry tonight, then I’ll move on  
Even the strongest love can be gone  

[Chorus]
Let it burn, let it fade  
All the love that we made  
If I hold on, it’ll only hurt  
Time to let it burn  

[Outro]
Let it burn...
