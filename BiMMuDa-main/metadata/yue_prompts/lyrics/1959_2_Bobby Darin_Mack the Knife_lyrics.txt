[Verse]
Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear  
But Mack, he hides his with a sneer  
He walks so smooth, talks so sweet  
But danger dances at his feet  

[Chorus]
Mack the Knife, he moves at night  
You won’t see him 'til he bites  
With a whisper, flash, and grin  
That’s when Mack comes slippin’ in  

[Verse]
He don’t shout, he don’t brag  
But he's the shadow with the swag  
Silk suit sharp, eyes like ice  
Mack don’t play, he rolls the dice  

[Bridge]
No one sees the way he goes  
But ask around, the story grows  

[Outro]
So watch your step and cross your heart  
Mack the Knife will play his part
