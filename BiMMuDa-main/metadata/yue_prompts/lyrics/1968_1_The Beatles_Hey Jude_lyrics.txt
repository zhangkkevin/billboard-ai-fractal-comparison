[Verse]
Hey Jude, don’t feel afraid  
You’ve got the strength you’ve always made  
Take a sad song, make it glow  
And let your broken heart still grow  

[Chorus]
Hey Jude, the world’s your stage  
Turn the sorrow into rage  
Don’t carry pain that you outgrew  
You’ve got more love than you ever knew  

[Verse]
The night may try to pull you in  
But let the sunrise kiss your skin  
You’re not alone, we sing along  
To every word that makes you strong  

[Bridge]
La-la-la-la, life goes on  
With every step, you’ll find where you belong  

[Outro]
Hey Jude, keep moving on  
You’re the reason for this song
