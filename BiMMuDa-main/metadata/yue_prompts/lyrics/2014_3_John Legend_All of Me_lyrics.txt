[Verse]
What would I do without your flaws?  
You break the rules, rewrite the laws  
You’re chaos dressed in Sunday white  
But I would love you every night  

[Chorus]
All of me loves all of you  
Every scar and shade of blue  
You’re my heart and I’m your proof  
That all of me belongs to you  

[Verse]
You lose your way, I’ll be your map  
You fall apart, I’ll hold the gap  
Even when you push away  
I’ll be right here, I’ll always stay  

[Bridge]
You don’t have to be the light  
I’ll still see you in the night  

[Chorus]
All of me loves all of you  
Every scar and shade of blue  
You’re my heart and I’m your proof  
That all of me belongs to you
