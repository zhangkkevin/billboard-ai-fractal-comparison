[Intro]  
Crimson roses, soft and wild  
Like her lips when she smiled  

[Verse]  
Crimson roses in her hair  
Framed her face beyond compare  
Every time she passed me by  
The world stood still, I can’t deny  

[Verse]  
Crimson roses by her bed  
Where her sweetest words were said  
When she whispered low to me  
She bloomed like spring eternally  

[Chorus]  
I held her close in evening’s light  
She glowed beneath the stars so bright  
But seasons change, and hearts can fade  
Now only petals still remain  

[Verse]  
Crimson roses now are dry  
But I still see her in the sky  
Though she’s gone, I still believe  
She left her love for me to grieve  

[Outro]  
Crimson roses, never gray  
In my heart, they’ll stay
