[Verse]
I thought I knew what love was like  
But now it spins me every night  
You hold me close, then walk away  
Yet I come back, I always stay  

[Chorus]
I keep fallin', deeper in  
Every time I think we’ve reached the end  
You pull me back like nothin’ changed  
And I fall, fall again  

[Verse]
You’re a fire I can’t contain  
A sudden joy, a constant rain  
I hate to love, I love the pain  
Still I fall, again and again  

[Bridge]
Can’t escape the way you feel  
Can’t deny what’s always real  

[Chorus]
I keep fallin', deeper in  
Every time I think we’ve reached the end  
You pull me back like nothin’ changed  
And I fall, fall again  

[Outro]
I fall again
