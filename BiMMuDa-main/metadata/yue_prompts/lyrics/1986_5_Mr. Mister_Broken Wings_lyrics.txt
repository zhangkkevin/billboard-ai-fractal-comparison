[Verse]
Baby, don’t let go tonight  
These shattered dreams still hold us tight  
We’ve flown too high to fall so far  
But love can heal each hidden scar  

[Chorus]
Take these broken wings  
Teach them how to fly again  
Let the wind become our guide  
We’ll find the strength we keep inside  

[Verse]
We’ve known the dark, we’ve faced the fire  
But still we hold this strange desire  
To rise again, to touch the skies  
With all our fears and open eyes  

[Bridge]
No more silence, no more doubt  
We’ll learn what love is all about  

[Outro]
Take these broken wings, be strong  
Together we’ve been whole all along
