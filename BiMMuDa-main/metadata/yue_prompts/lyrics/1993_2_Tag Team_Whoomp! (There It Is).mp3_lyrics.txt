[Verse]
Step into the groove, don’t be shy  
Let the rhythm amplify  
We came to move, came to play  
And dance until the break of day  

[Chorus]
Whoomp! There it is  
Feel the beat, feel the bliss  
Hands up, shake the floor  
This is what we came here for  

[Verse]
The bass is deep, the night is young  
We speak with motion, not our tongue  
No holding back, no delay  
Just ride the wave and shout “okay!”  

[Bridge]
Let the rhythm guide your soul  
Lose yourself and take control  

[Outro]
Whoomp! There it is, we rise  
Underneath these neon skies
