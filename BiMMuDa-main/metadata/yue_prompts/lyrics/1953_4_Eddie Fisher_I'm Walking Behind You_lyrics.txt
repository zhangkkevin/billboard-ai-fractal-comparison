[Verse]
I’m walking behind you, step by step  
Through a love I couldn’t keep  
You hold his hand, I lower mine  
And hide my tears where shadows sleep  

[Chorus]
I’m walking behind you, though you don’t see  
You took your heart away from me  
Each silent step, a dream once new  
Now lost in memories of you  

[Verse]
The wedding bells, they echo slow  
While I pretend to let you go  
But every vow you speak today  
Was one I hoped that you would say  

[Bridge]
Love doesn’t end, it just moves on  
I’ll follow even when you’re gone  

[Outro]
I’m walking behind you, far apart  
Still holding you inside my heart
