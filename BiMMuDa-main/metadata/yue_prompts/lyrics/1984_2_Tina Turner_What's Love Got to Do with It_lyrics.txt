[Verse]
You hold my hand, but not my soul  
You play a part, not the whole  
My heart’s not made for games like this  
Where every truth feels hit or miss  

[Chorus]
What’s love got to do with it?  
If all it brings is pain a bit  
It’s just a word, a passing tide  
Don’t need it if I’ve got my pride  

[Verse]
You call it love, I call it lost  
Every kiss comes with a cost  
I’ve seen the signs, I’ve played along  
But this time I know you’re wrong  

[Bridge]
I’m stronger than this scripted play  
Don’t need a heart to find my way  

[Outro]
What’s love got to do with it?  
I’ll walk alone and never quit
