[Verse]
I wander in a world gone dim  
Hoping you’ll come back again  
But every shadow hides your light  
And I get lost in endless night  

[Chorus]
But your lights, they guide me home  
Through the dark where I used to roam  
When I fall, they pull me through  
I find the light again in you  

[Verse]
My heartbeat echoes with the sound  
Of every time you’re not around  
But still your glow is on my skin  
Reminding me of where I’ve been  

[Bridge]
I’m not afraid of what I see  
As long as you keep shining me  

[Chorus]
Your lights, they guide me home  
Through the dark where I used to roam  
When I fall, they pull me through  
I find the light again in you
