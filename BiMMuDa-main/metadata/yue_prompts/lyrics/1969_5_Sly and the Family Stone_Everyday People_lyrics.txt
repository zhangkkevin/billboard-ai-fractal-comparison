[Verse]
I am no better, you are no less  
We all carry different kinds of stress  
Short or tall, dark or light  
We’re all reaching for the same daylight  

[Chorus]
Everyday people, side by side  
In every city, every tide  
We laugh, we cry, we all believe  
In something we hope to achieve  

[Verse]
You may wear a different name  
But your dreams still burn the same  
So let’s not build a wall of shame  
Let’s play a brand new game  

[Bridge]
Hold my hand and lift your voice  
In love and peace, we all rejoice  

[Outro]
Everyday people, one and true  
And that includes me and you
