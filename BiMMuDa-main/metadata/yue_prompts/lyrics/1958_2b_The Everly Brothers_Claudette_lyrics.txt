[Verse]
Claudette, you're fire and rhythm too  
Every step you take’s a groove  
When you laugh, the jukebox plays  
You light up my rockin’ days  

[Chorus]
Claudette, come swing with me  
You’re a spark in harmony  
From the twist down to your smile  
You’ve got me jumpin’ all the while  

[Verse]
You wear your joy just like a crown  
When you’re near, I can’t slow down  
One look and I can’t forget  
That I’m in love with sweet Claudette  

[Bridge]
Even when the lights go low  
You're the beat that steals the show  

[Outro]
Claudette, oh can’t you see?  
You’re the only one for me
