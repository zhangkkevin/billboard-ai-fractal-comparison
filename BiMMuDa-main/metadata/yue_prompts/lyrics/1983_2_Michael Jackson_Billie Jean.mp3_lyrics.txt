[Verse]
She danced into the room like flame  
With eyes that burned and spoke my name  
She whispered secrets with a smile  
And stayed with me a little while  

[Chorus]
Billie Jean is not my love  
She's a shadow rising from above  
The child, she says, belongs to me  
But that’s not my reality  

[Verse]
I gave her time, I gave her songs  
But never knew where I belonged  
She drew the line, then crossed it twice  
And wrapped the truth in sugar and ice  

[Bridge]
Now every night I hear her call  
But I was never there at all  

[Outro]
Billie Jean, you’re just a flame  
Dancing wild but not to blame
