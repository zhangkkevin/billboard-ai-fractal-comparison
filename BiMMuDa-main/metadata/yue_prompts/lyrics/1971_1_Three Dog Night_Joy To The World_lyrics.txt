[Verse]  
Woke up laughing in the rain  
Shook off trouble, danced through pain  
Every stranger, every friend  
Sang a song that had no end  

[Chorus]  
Joy to the world, we’ll sing it loud  
Raise your hands above the crowd  
Let the rivers roll with light  
Turn the darkness into bright  

[Verse]  
Found a rhythm in the street  
Heard the music in our feet  
Even hearts that lost their way  
Found a voice in what we play  

[Bridge]  
It don’t matter who you’ve been  
Love will let the light back in  

[Outro]  
Joy to the world, joy to the skies  
To the laughter in our eyes
