[Intro]
Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, oh no no  

[Verse]
You got me lookin’ so crazy right now  
My mind’s a storm, can’t figure out how  
I walk in heels but my heart just trips  
You steal my breath with those lips  

[Chorus]
Got me crazy in love  
I’m not myself when I think of us  
Your kiss is fire, your touch is gold  
With you, I lose control  

[Verse]
My friends say I should slow it down  
But your smile spins me around  
When you say my name, I break  
Like thunder in a quiet place  

[Bridge]
What is this spell you put on me?  
I can’t resist, I can't be free  

[Chorus]
Got me crazy in love  
I’m not myself when I think of us  
Your kiss is fire, your touch is gold  
With you, I lose control  

[Outro]
Uh oh, uh oh
