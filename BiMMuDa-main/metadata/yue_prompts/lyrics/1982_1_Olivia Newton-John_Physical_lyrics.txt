[Verse]
I see you looking, standing there  
The heat is rising in the air  
Forget the talk, forget the games  
Let's feed this fire, spark the flames  

[Chorus]
Let’s get physical, feel the rush  
Move your body, feel the hush  
No more thinking, just the beat  
Let our shadows find the heat  

[Verse]
Every breath pulls me in  
Your touch is lightning on my skin  
Close the distance, drop the guise  
Let's burn beneath these disco skies  

[Bridge]
We don’t need to speak at all  
The rhythm is our only call  

[Outro]
Let’s get physical tonight  
Underneath the neon light
