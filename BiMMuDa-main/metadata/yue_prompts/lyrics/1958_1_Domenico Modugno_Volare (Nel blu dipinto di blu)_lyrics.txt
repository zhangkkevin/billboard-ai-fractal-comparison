[Verse]
I dream I’m flying in the blue  
The sky wraps round like love from you  
My arms are wings, my breath is light  
You pull me into velvet night  

[Chorus]
Volare, fly with me  
Above the clouds, above the sea  
Let the stars begin to spin  
We’ll dance where dreams begin  

[Verse]
The world below can fade away  
As long as in your arms I stay  
Each word you sing becomes my sky  
And every glance lifts me high  

[Bridge]
Painted blue, my soul feels free  
Nel blu, I'm where I'm meant to be  

[Outro]
Volare, amore mio  
In your love, I rise and go
