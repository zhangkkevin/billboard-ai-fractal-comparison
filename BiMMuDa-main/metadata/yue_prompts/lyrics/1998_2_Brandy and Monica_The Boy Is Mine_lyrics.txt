[Verse]
I see you watching, trying to claim  
But this heart ain't part of your game  
You think you know what we had  
But girl, you're reading the signs all bad  

[Chorus]
The boy is mine, no room to share  
Don’t act like he was never there  
You can talk, but I won’t budge  
This ain’t a case for you to judge  

[Verse]
He made his choice, it wasn’t you  
Stop pretending it’s not true  
I’m not the one who came too late  
Now you’re just pushing fate  

[Bridge]
You can’t rewrite what’s already done  
He’s with me — you had your run  

[Outro]
The boy is mine, that’s the deal  
Now move on and start to heal
