[Intro]
Whoa, oh, oh  

[Verse]
I breathe it in, this morning air  
Feels like the end is everywhere  
Ashes fall like paper snow  
This new world is all I know  

[Chorus]
Radioactive, under skin  
A fire starts where fears begin  
This silence screams, the ground it shakes  
But from the dust, a soul awakes  

[Verse]
Steel and stone, no place to hide  
But there’s a storm I hold inside  
This isn’t death, it’s second birth  
I’m made anew upon this earth  

[Bridge]
The old is gone, the light is near  
I rise above the smoke and fear  

[Chorus]
Radioactive, under skin  
A fire starts where fears begin  
This silence screams, the ground it shakes  
But from the dust, a soul awakes
