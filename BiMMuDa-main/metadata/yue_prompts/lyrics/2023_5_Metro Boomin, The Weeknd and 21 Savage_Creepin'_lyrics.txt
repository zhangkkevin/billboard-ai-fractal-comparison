[Intro]  
I been movin’ quiet, late at night  
Don’t wanna start a fire, but I just might  

[Verse]  
Shadows on the walls don’t lie  
You left your truth in another guy  
I see your phone light glowin’ slow  
When you think I don’t know  

[Chorus]  
Why you creepin’ when the lights go low?  
Actin’ different when you’re on your own  
Told me lies, then said you care  
But I can feel the empty air  

[Verse]  
Used to think we had it right  
But love don’t hide from light  
I gave my soul, I paid the fee  
Now you’re just a ghost to me  

[Bridge – Rap Style]  
Played me sweet, now I see through  
You were sneakin' like I never knew  
Whispers late, steps so light  
But shadows always spill the night  

[Outro]  
You were creepin’, yeah I know  
Now I’m lettin’ your secrets go
