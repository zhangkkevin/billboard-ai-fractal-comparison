[Verse]
Bare skin, no place to hide  
Love runs cold, I can't decide  
Is it pain or is it pride?  
When doves cry, I feel denied  

[Chorus]
This is what it sounds like  
When doves cry in the night  
Tears with no goodbye  
Just broken wings in flight  

[Verse]
You touch like fire, then turn to ice  
The price of love, the sharpest slice  
I scream in silence, you donâ€™t hear  
Just the echo of my fear  

[Bridge]
Tell me now, do you feel the same?  
Or was I just another name?  

[Outro]
No more tears left to supply  
This is how it feels when doves cry
