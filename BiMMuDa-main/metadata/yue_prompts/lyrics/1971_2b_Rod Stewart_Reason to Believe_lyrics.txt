[Verse]  
I saw you cry and say you’re fine  
But silence drew another line  
You smiled and I believed again  
Though I knew how it would end  

[Chorus]  
Still I find a reason to believe  
Even when your words deceive  
It’s not hope that makes me stay  
It’s the ghost of yesterday  

[Verse]  
I held you close through fading years  
My hands still full of old ideas  
Each promise made, each story spun  
Still stings beneath the setting sun  

[Bridge]  
Maybe lies are just a thread  
That keep old memories from the dead  

[Outro]  
Reason to believe, though it’s untrue  
I still find it — all in you
