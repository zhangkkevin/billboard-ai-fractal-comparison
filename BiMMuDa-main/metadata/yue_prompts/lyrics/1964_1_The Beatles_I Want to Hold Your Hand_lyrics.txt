[Verse]
Oh yeah, I tell you something  
You’ve got me running  
My heart’s on fire  
With a sweet desire  

[Chorus]
I want to hold your hand  
Walk you across this land  
With every breath I take  
It’s you I’ll never fake  

[Verse]
When you smile, I lose control  
You wrap your love around my soul  
All the world just fades away  
When I hear you say  

[Bridge]
Take my hand, don’t let go  
We’ve got more than we know  

[Outro]
I want to hold your hand  
And never let it end
