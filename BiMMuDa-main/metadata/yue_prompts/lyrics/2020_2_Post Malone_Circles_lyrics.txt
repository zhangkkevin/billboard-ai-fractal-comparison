[Verse]
We couldn’t keep it straight, kept turning round  
Tried to build on shifting ground  
You said forever, then let go  
Left me lost in what I know  

[Chorus]
We’re running in circles, back to pain  
Every time it’s just the same  
Chasing ghosts we can’t outrun  
Loving you was never done  

[Verse]
Words like knives but meant to heal  
I can’t tell what’s fake or real  
We said goodbye then said hello  
Now I don’t know where to go  

[Bridge]
If love is time, then ours ran dry  
But I still miss you when I try  

[Chorus]
We’re running in circles, back to pain  
Every time it’s just the same  
Chasing ghosts we can’t outrun  
Loving you was never done
