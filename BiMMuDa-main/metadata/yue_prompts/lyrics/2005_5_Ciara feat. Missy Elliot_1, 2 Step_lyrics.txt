[Intro]
Automatic, supersonic, funky fresh  

[Verse]
Move your body, hit the beat  
Feel the rhythm in your feet  
Left to right and back again  
We keep it smooth from start to end  

[Chorus]
1, 2 step, everybody dance  
Feel the fire, take a chance  
Drop it low and bring it up  
We ain’t never had enough  

[Verse]
We in the spot, we get it live  
Turn it up and let it ride  
From the front to the back  
We keep it tight, now bring it back  

[Bridge]
Missy said it, now it’s time  
Get on the floor, make it shine  

[Chorus]
1, 2 step, everybody dance  
Feel the fire, take a chance  
Drop it low and bring it up  
We ain’t never had enough
