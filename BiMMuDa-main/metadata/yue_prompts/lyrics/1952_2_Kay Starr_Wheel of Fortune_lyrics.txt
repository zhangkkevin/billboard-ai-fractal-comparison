[Verse]
Spin that wheel and close your eyes  
Hope’s a game with no disguise  
Fate decides with every turn  
Will it heal or will it burn?  

[Chorus]
Wheel of fortune, roll again  
Will I lose or will I win?  
Place my heart and take the bet  
But I ain’t folded yet  

[Bridge]
Lady Luck, don’t pass me by  
Give this love another try  

[Outro]
Wheel of fortune, round we go  
Where it stops, I’ll never know
