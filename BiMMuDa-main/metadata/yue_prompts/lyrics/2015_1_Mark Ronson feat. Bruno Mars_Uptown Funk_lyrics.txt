[Intro]
Doh! This hit, that ice cold...  

[Verse]
Step out fresh in a tailored suit  
Shoes so slick, I don’t need to boot  
We run this town, we run this beat  
Snap your fingers, move your feet  

[Chorus]
Uptown funk, don’t give a damn  
We groove hard, we break the jam  
From streetlight glam to velvet touch  
Uptown brings it, just too much  

[Verse]
Stop, wait a minute  
Pour that rhythm, now get in it  
Silk and gold, that throwback vibe  
This is soul, this is pride  

[Bridge]
If you sexy and you know it  
Let that uptown rhythm show it  

[Chorus]
Uptown funk, don’t give a damn  
We groove hard, we break the jam  
From streetlight glam to velvet touch  
Uptown brings it, just too much
