[Intro]
West coast, best coast  

[Verse]
Sunset skies and ocean breeze  
Flip-flop steps, we move with ease  
Cherry lips, golden tan  
We got the world right in our hands  

[Chorus]
California gurls, we shine so bright  
From Malibu to neon nights  
Ice cream smiles and wild curls  
This is the place that rules the world  

[Verse]
Palm trees sway, DJ spins  
Laughter loud, let’s dive right in  
Sippin’ sweet on pink champagne  
Let’s dance beneath the sun and rain  

[Bridge]
You ain’t seen magic till you’ve seen this  
Sun-kissed queens, it’s bliss  

[Chorus]
California gurls, we shine so bright  
From Malibu to neon nights  
Ice cream smiles and wild curls  
This is the place that rules the world
