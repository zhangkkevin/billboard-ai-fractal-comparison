[Verse]
I walked through fire, played the game  
But never felt quite the same  
Then you came close, and changed my view  
Everything felt raw and new  

[Chorus]
Like a virgin, touched for the very first time  
With your heartbeat close to mine  
You made me feel reborn again  
Like a flame without the pain  

[Verse]
Your hands, so soft, they spoke in waves  
They taught me how a heart behaves  
You stripped the armor from my soul  
Now all I want is to be whole  

[Bridge]
You brought the light, you cleared the haze  
I'm learning love in brand new ways  

[Outro]
Like a virgin, fresh and free  
You made a new world out of me
