[Verse]  
Sittin’ here under clouds of gray  
Watchin’ the people drift away  
Rain keeps fallin’ on my knees  
But I don’t mind, I’m feelin’ free  

[Chorus]  
I’m just wastin’ time in the rain  
Tryna wash off all my pain  
I’ve been runnin’, I’ve been tryin’  
But now I’m just sit-in’ still and dryin’  

[Verse]  
Left my home and my worn-out shoes  
Chasin’ dreams I was bound to lose  
City lights never showed me love  
Just neon signs and skies above  

[Chorus]  
So I’m wastin’ time in the rain  
Let it fall and let it stain  
Ain’t no riches, ain’t no name  
But peace don’t come with fame  

[Bridge]  
Maybe one day I’ll move again  
But right now I’m my only friend  
I’ve got this bench, I’ve got this sound  
Of the rain beatin’ on the ground  

[Outro]  
Wastin’ time in the rain,  
Let it wash away my name  
I’ll sit here till I fade  
With nothin’ left to trade
