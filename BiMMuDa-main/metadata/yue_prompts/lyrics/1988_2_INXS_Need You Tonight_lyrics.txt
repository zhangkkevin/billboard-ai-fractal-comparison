[Verse]
The city sleeps but I’m awake  
Your name’s a fire I can’t shake  
I reach for you in empty space  
Craving just a single trace  

[Chorus]
I need you tonight  
Can’t hide from this light  
You’re the echo in my veins  
Driving me beyond the chains  

[Verse]
No words are left to cover truth  
You’re the fever in my youth  
The rhythm pulls, the shadows dance  
I’m caught inside a wild trance  

[Bridge]
Come to me, don't hesitate  
This desire won’t wait  

[Outro]
I need you tonight  
To make this wrong feel right
