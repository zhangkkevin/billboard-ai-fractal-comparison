[Verse]
When you're weary, feeling small  
When tears come down like rainfall  
I'll be the calm beyond your tide  
A hand in yours, right by your side  

[Chorus]
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will help you find  

[Verse]
When shadows fall and friends are few  
My light will still shine on you  
Iâ€™ll carry you when strength is gone  
Together, we keep holding on  

[Bridge]
In storms or silence, I remain  
A quiet song through all your pain  

[Outro]
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will see you through
