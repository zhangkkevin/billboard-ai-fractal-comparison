[Intro]
Cranked the jukebox, dropped a dime  
Found a rhythm, felt the time  

[Verse]
Saw you standin’ near the light  
Leather jacket, eyes so bright  
You had a swagger, I had the song  
We both knew we'd get along  

[Chorus]
I love rock 'n roll  
Blast it loud and lose control  
Turn it up, let the rhythm roll  
Yeah, I love rock 'n roll  

[Verse]
You moved close, the sparks took flight  
We owned that dive all Friday night  
You raised your glass, I played my part  
Two rebels tearing up the dark  

[Bridge]
It ain’t about the fame or gold  
It’s that fire you can’t hold  

[Outro]
I love rock 'n roll  
It’s the beat that saves my soul
