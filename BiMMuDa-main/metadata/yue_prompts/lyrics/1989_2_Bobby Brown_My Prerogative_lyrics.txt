[Verse]
People talk, they always will  
Try to break your spirit still  
But I’ve got fire, I’ve got drive  
And I won’t fade just to survive  

[Chorus]
It’s my prerogative, my way  
I do what I want, night or day  
You don’t have to understand  
This is me, I take a stand  

[Verse]
I walk with rhythm, speak my truth  
Don’t need your version of my youth  
I’m not a puppet, not your plan  
I live my life the way I can  

[Bridge]
Judgment’s easy from the side  
But I’ve got nothing left to hide  

[Outro]
My prerogative, my song  
I’ve been free all along
