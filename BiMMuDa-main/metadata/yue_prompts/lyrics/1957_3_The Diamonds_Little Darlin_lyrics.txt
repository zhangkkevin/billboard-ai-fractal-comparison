[Intro]
Ooh, little darlin’... yeah yeah yeah...  

[Verse]
Little darlin’, won't you stay  
Don't let the music fade away  
Your laugh’s a song, your eyes a fire  
You’re every note in my desire  

[Chorus]
Little darlin’, hold me near  
Whisper love I need to hear  
With every clap and harmony  
You’re the only one for me  

[Verse]
We spin beneath the silver moon  
The night plays on, a doo-wop tune  
The stars all blink when you walk by  
They sparkle in your lullaby  

[Bridge]
You’re the reason I believe  
That true love don’t ever leave  

[Outro]
Little darlin’, now I see  
You're the beat inside of me
