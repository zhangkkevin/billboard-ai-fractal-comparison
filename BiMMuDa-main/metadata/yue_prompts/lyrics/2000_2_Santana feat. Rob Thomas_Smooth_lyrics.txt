[Verse]
Your touch is like a summer flame  
Whispers heat, but plays no game  
You're a rhythm in my veins  
Spinning love like warm champagne  

[Chorus]
You’re so smooth, it’s unreal  
Every move’s a way to feel  
Got me melting in your sound  
With no way to slow me down  

[Verse]
Your body’s jazz, your lips are soul  
Every glance is full control  
I’m dancing under your command  
Like waves obeying land  

[Bridge]
You play me like a tune so sweet  
Got me swaying in the heat  

[Outro]
You're smooth, and I’m your song  
Together we can’t go wrong
