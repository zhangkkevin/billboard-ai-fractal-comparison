[Verse]
She’s got mystery in her glance  
Like a phantom in a trance  
Every move, a silent game  
She plays with charm, never shame  

[Chorus]
She’s got Bette Davis eyes  
Cool and sharp, no disguise  
You won’t know what’s on her mind  
But she’ll haunt you every time  

[Verse]
Her words are soft, but cut like steel  
She takes what’s hers, makes you feel  
Like love’s a gamble she can win  
And you fall before you begin  

[Bridge]
You can run, but can’t resist  
She’s a dream you won’t dismiss  

[Outro]
She’s got Bette Davis eyes  
And the truth behind the lies
