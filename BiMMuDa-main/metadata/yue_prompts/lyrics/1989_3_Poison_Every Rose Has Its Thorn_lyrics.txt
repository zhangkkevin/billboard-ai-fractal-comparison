[Verse]
We shared a laugh, we shared a cry  
But even love can say goodbye  
The night was warm, the morning cold  
And now I’m left with stories told  

[Chorus]
Every rose has its thorn  
Every heart can feel worn  
We gave our best, but still we fell  
A truth too hard for words to tell  

[Verse]
I play our song, it makes me ache  
Another dream begins to break  
You held my hand, then slipped away  
And left a scar I feel today  

[Bridge]
No one wins when silence grows  
We’re just petals in the snow  

[Outro]
Every rose, every thorn  
Marks a love that's been reborn
