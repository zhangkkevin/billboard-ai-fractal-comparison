[Intro]
In 1814, we took a little trip...  

[Verse]
We marched down south with a rebel yell  
Drums were snappin’, stories to tell  
The river roared, the cannons fired  
We fought with grit and never tired  

[Chorus]
We fought the fight in New Orleans  
Through muddy banks and musket scenes  
And when the smoke began to clear  
We cheered so loud they had to hear  

[Verse]
The banjos rang with every stride  
We kept Old Glory waving wide  
They thought we’d run, but stood our ground  
Sent 'em packin’ outta town  

[Bridge]
With fiddle tunes and marching beat  
We stomped the ground with steady feet  

[Outro]
We made a mark, we stood up tall  
The Battle of New Orleans said it all
