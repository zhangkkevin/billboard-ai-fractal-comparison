[Verse]
There ain’t no gold in these regrets  
Only lessons I can't forget  
I tried to be the strength you lack  
But all I did was hold you back  

[Chorus]
Go easy on me, I was just a child  
Trying to love you, lost and wild  
Did my best with broken parts  
But you still broke my heart  

[Verse]
I made mistakes, I know that's true  
But I gave every piece to you  
You saw the cracks before the light  
And left before I made it right  

[Bridge]
If love is hard, then teach me how  
But don’t condemn who I was then or now  

[Chorus]
Go easy on me, I was just a child  
Trying to love you, lost and wild  
Did my best with broken parts  
But you still broke my heart
