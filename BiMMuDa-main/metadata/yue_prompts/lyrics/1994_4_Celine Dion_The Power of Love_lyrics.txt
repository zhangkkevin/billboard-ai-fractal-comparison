[Verse]
When the world feels far and cold  
You’re the warmth I need to hold  
Every heartbeat, every sigh  
You lift me up, you help me fly  

[Chorus]
That’s the power of love  
Stronger than the stars above  
It carries me when I fall  
And answers every silent call  

[Verse]
Through the fire and through the rain  
You’re the cure for every pain  
You don’t speak, but I still hear  
Your love’s the voice I hold so dear  

[Bridge]
In your eyes, I find the light  
That makes the darkest moments bright  

[Outro]
That’s the power I believe  
The love you give, the love I need
