[Verse]  
Goodbye to the flame that never swayed  
You danced through storms, but never stayed  
The world applauded from their seats  
But never heard your heartbeat  

[Chorus]  
You were a candle in the wind  
Burning bright, then dim again  
We watched you shine and fade away  
And wished youâ€™d found a place to stay  

[Verse]  
They dressed your name in silver praise  
But never saw your quiet days  
You gave your light, then slipped from view  
And left the night still missing you  

[Bridge]  
Fame is cold and time moves fast  
But your memory will always last  

[Outro]  
Still a candle in the wind  
Still the voice that sang within
