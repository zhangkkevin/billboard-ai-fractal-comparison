[Verse]
We go through this every time  
You say you're done, then cross the line  
I try to walk but then you call  
I swear I hate it, but I fall  

[Chorus]
I’m foolish, caught in this game  
I know the rules but love the flame  
You break my heart, then heal the pain  
I’m foolish, over and again  

[Verse]
I cry at night, then smile by day  
You sweet-talk all my tears away  
It’s toxic love I can't deny  
But I still run, I still try  

[Bridge]
You know just how to make me stay  
Even when I walk away  

[Chorus]
I’m foolish, caught in this game  
I know the rules but love the flame  
You break my heart, then heal the pain  
I’m foolish, over and again  

[Outro]
I can’t let go
