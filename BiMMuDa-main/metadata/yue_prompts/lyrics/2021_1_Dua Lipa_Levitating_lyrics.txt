[Verse]
I was lost in the dark, drifting slow  
Then you came with that cosmic glow  
Took my hand, now I float in light  
You're the spark that changed my night  

[Chorus]
Levitating, caught in your vibe  
We’re weightless when our hearts collide  
Take me up, don’t let me down  
We’re stars that never hit the ground  

[Verse]
Your rhythm’s got me feeling bold  
Your laughter’s worth more than gold  
Spin me fast, keep time away  
Let this feeling always stay  

[Bridge]
Gravity don’t hold me here  
Only your voice keeps me near  

[Chorus]
Levitating, caught in your vibe  
We’re weightless when our hearts collide  
Take me up, don’t let me down  
We’re stars that never hit the ground
