[Verse]
I still hear your voice at dawn  
Though the night keeps moving on  
Your shadow dances on my wall  
And I still wait for you to call  

[Chorus]
I miss you more than I can say  
Each breath I take fades into gray  
The world goes on, but I stay still  
Caught in dreams I can’t fulfill  

[Verse]
The laughter lingers in the air  
But when I reach, you’re never there  
I hold the pieces of our time  
Trying to fit what’s left behind  

[Bridge]
They say that time will mend the pain  
But all I feel is falling rain  

[Outro]
I miss you, through and through  
There’s nothing that compares to you
