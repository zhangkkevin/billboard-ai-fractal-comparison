[Verse]
Without your touch, the world feels still  
I’m walking dreams against my will  
Each second hurts, each breath I fake  
I crumble more with each heartbreak  

[Chorus]
How do I live without your love?  
When all I knew was you above  
The stars don’t shine, the sun won’t rise  
When you’re not here, I close my eyes  

[Verse]
The wind don’t sing, the rain don’t fall  
Your voice was my heart’s only call  
I reach for shadows in the night  
But you’re not there to hold me tight  

[Bridge]
You’re my beginning, you’re my end  
My only truth, my only friend  

[Outro]
How do I live, now that you’re gone?  
Still trying to be strong
