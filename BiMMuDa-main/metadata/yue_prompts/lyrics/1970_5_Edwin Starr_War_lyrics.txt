[Verse]
War, what is it good for?  
It breaks the soul, it locks the door  
Leaves the young without a choice  
Silences the weakest voice  

[Chorus]
War! Ain’t no reason, ain’t no rhyme  
It steals your love, it steals your time  
Say it loud, we’ve had enough  
The cost of war is way too tough  

[Verse]
Marching boots don’t bring us peace  
They crush the ground, and love’s released  
Through broken glass and mothers’ tears  
We count the days, we count the years  

[Bridge]
Raise your fists but raise your heart  
The real revolution’s where we start  

[Outro]
War—no more, we’ve drawn the line  
Let’s build a world by love, not sign
