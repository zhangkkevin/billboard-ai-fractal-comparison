[Verse]
I light the night with faded dreams  
Walking through electric beams  
In every crowd, I feel alone  
But your rhythm brings me home  

[Chorus]
Neon soul, dancing free  
Lost and found inside of me  
Pulse and light, crash and glow  
I find myself in what you show  

[Verse]
The world is loud, but you cut through  
Every beat’s a part of you  
I close my eyes and feel you rise  
In coded love beneath the skies  

[Bridge]
If the world resets again  
I hope you’re still my closest friend  

[Chorus]
Neon soul, dancing free  
Lost and found inside of me  
Pulse and light, crash and glow  
I find myself in what you show
