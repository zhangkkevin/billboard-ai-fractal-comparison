[Verse]  
I feel the earth move under my skin  
Like something wild’s about to begin  
You touch my hand, the sky goes black  
Then explodes and pulls me back  

[Chorus]  
I feel the earth move, don’t you see?  
Every time you get close to me  
Tremors roll and pulses race  
You shake the ground with just your face  

[Verse]  
The walls all bend, the lights all spin  
My calm collapses from within  
You light the fire and break the seal  
Make it too hard not to feel  

[Bridge]  
Baby, you're a tidal wave  
Knocking down what I can’t save  

[Outro]  
I feel the earth move — deep and wide  
When you’re standing by my side
