[Verse]
My love is more than words can say  
She lights my sky and guides my way  
With every smile, she lifts me high  
She paints the dawn across my sky  

[Chorus]
My love, she walks in quiet grace  
Turns every room to sacred space  
With just one glance, she speaks the truth  
And makes me feel eternal youth  

[Verse]
Through every storm, she holds my hand  
And makes me feel I understand  
The kind of love that doesn’t fade  
But deepens every choice we’ve made  

[Bridge]
No song could hold her name just right  
She is the day, she is the night  

[Outro]
My love, forever she will be  
The soul that walks this world with me
