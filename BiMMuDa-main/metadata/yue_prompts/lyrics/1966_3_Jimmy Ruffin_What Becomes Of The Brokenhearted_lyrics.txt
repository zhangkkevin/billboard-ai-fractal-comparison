[Verse]
What becomes of a love gone wrong  
When nights feel twice as long?  
The smile you gave is just a ghost  
And hope’s the thing I miss the most  

[Chorus]
What becomes of the brokenhearted?  
Left behind, torn apart and started  
Walking down a one-way street  
With echoes where our hearts would meet  

[Verse]
I’ve tried to laugh, I’ve tried to mend  
But each day starts where dreams end  
The world keeps turning, unaware  
That I still look, but you’re not there  

[Bridge]
Maybe love is just a flame  
That burns too fast to leave a name  

[Outro]
What becomes of the ones who care?  
We carry love that isn’t there
