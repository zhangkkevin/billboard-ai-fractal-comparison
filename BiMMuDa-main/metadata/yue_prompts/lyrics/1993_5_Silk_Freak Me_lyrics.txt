[Verse]
Your touch is thunder in the night  
You draw me in without a fight  
No need for words, just what we feel  
This moment’s fire, raw and real  

[Chorus]
Let me freak you, slow and sweet  
Feel the rhythm in the heat  
Every breath, every sound  
Let our bodies spin around  

[Verse]
Silk and sweat, a perfect blend  
No beginning, no end  
You light a flame I can’t deny  
You take me low, then lift me high  

[Bridge]
Lose control, give in to lust  
Let desire earn your trust  

[Outro]
Let me freak you through and through  
Every move, just me and you
