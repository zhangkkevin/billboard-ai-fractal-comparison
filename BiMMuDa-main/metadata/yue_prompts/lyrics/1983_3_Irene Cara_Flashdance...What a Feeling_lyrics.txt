[Intro]
One breath, one chance  
One spark, one dance  

[Verse]  
Lights are low but my heart's alive  
Every step is where I thrive  
Chasing fire through the night  
Turning struggle into flight  

[Chorus]  
What a feeling, when I'm soaring  
Through the rhythm, I’m restoring  
All my dreams in one bright motion  
Rising with electric ocean  

[Verse]  
Tears have fallen, storms have passed  
But I found my strength at last  
With the beat beneath my skin  
I feel my soul begin to win  

[Bridge]  
This is more than just a stage  
It’s my spirit off the cage  

[Outro]  
What a feeling, can’t deny it  
When I dance, I feel like lightning  
This is me and I’m revealing  
Every truth in what I’m feeling
