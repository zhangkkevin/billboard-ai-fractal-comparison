[Verse]
Baby, I need just one more move  
Your body close, we find our groove  
The night is short, the beat is strong  
One more dance to right the wrong  

[Chorus]
I need one dance, just you and me  
Lose ourselves, just let it be  
In your arms, I find my peace  
Don’t let this rhythm ever cease  

[Verse]
The lights are dim, the crowd fades out  
But you’re the only thing I’m about  
Swaying slow, locked in time  
Your heartbeat echoing in mine  

[Bridge]
Let’s make this moment stretch and bend  
Until the dawn becomes the end  

[Chorus]
I need one dance, just you and me  
Lose ourselves, just let it be  
In your arms, I find my peace  
Don’t let this rhythm ever cease
