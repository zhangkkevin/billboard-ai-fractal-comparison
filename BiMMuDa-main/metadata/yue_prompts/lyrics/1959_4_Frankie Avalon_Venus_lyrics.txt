[Verse]
Venus, goddess from above  
Send me someone I can love  
With golden hair and eyes so kind  
Bring the love I long to find  

[Chorus]
Venus, hear this mortal plea  
Grant a heart that beats for me  
Send her down with stars and light  
Let her hold me every night  

[Verse]
I’ve waited long, I’ve dreamed in vain  
Let her ease this lonely pain  
She doesn’t need to rule or reign  
Just walk beside me through the rain  

[Bridge]
If your magic still is true  
Bring her soul, so bright and new  

[Outro]
Venus, let my wish be known  
Don't let me be alone
