[Verse]  
I talk to mirrors like they’re friends  
Try to rewrite how the story ends  
But every crack still knows my face  
I’m chasing peace I can’t replace  

[Chorus]  
I’m the problem, that’s been clear  
A ghost that I’ve dragged year to year  
I wear the crown of my regret  
A queen of flaws I can’t forget  

[Verse]  
I make jokes that cover screams  
Rewrite pain in pastel dreams  
Smile wide, but never whole  
A heart too loud to stay in control  

[Bridge]  
If you saw me at my worst  
Would you still think I was worth the curse?  

[Outro]  
I’m the anti-hero in disguise  
Still hoping love will recognize
