[Verse]
You move like mist across the floor  
And I can’t take it anymore  
You're here and gone, a mystery  
But still you pull the breath from me  

[Chorus]
Shadow dancing, hearts romancing  
Lost in time and second glancing  
I chase your light and feel your heat  
But all I hold are restless beats  

[Verse]
Each step you take, the world goes still  
My body moves against its will  
I reach for you but find the night  
Still I keep dancing to your light  

[Bridge]
You haunt the rhythm of my mind  
A ghost I’m hoping still to find  

[Outro]
Shadow dancing, fading slow  
You're the flame I'll always know
