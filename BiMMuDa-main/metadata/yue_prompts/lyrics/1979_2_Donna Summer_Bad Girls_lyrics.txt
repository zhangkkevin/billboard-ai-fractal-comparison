[Verse]
They walk the line, heels to the street  
With every glance, they own the beat  
No rules, no chains, just flashing eyes  
They live beneath the city skies  

[Chorus]
Bad girls, dancing through the fire  
Turning danger into desire  
You can’t tame what moves that fast  
They burn too bright, they never last  

[Verse]
They’ve got a story, got a flame  
They’re more than just a whispered name  
Every step a quiet shout  
Saying this is what it’s all about  

[Bridge]
Don’t judge the dress, don’t call them wrong  
They’ve been tough and fierce so long  

[Outro]
Bad girls, breaking through the haze  
Living wild in neon blaze
