[Verse]
I’m at a payphone, out in the cold  
Coins in hand, stories retold  
You left a silence I can’t break  
I called you now for old time’s sake  

[Chorus]
If happy ever afters fade  
Then why do I still feel this way?  
Tried to reach you through this tone  
But it’s too late, and I’m alone  

[Verse]
You moved on, I stayed behind  
Still rewinding through my mind  
Your number’s gone, your name erased  
But somehow I still see your face  

[Bridge]
One more call before I go  
Just needed you to know  

[Chorus]
If happy ever afters fade  
Then why do I still feel this way?  
Tried to reach you through this tone  
But it’s too late, and I’m alone
