[Verse]
You were the strength I never found  
The one who kept my feet on ground  
When storms came rushing through the door  
You gave me wings, you made me soar  

[Chorus]
Because you loved me, I found grace  
In every shadow, in every place  
You believed when no one tried  
You stood behind me, arms open wide  

[Verse]
You gave me hope when dreams felt far  
You taught me who I truly are  
And even when I lost my way  
You held my hand, you chose to stay  

[Bridge]
Every tear and every mile  
You were there to make me smile  

[Outro]
Because you loved me, I still stand  
With all I am, by your hand
