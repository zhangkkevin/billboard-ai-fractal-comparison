[Verse]
Empty pillow, faded bed  
All the words we never said  
Snow was falling, hearts were warm  
But love can never keep its form  

[Chorus]
It must have been love  
But it’s over now  
Like a whisper lost in time  
A moment we can’t rewind  

[Verse]
You smiled like spring, then turned away  
Left me frozen in that day  
I still see your shadow pass  
But nothing ever seems to last  

[Bridge]
Dreams don’t always match the dawn  
But the memory lingers on  

[Outro]
It must have been love  
But it's gone somehow
