[Verse]
I came from the ground, dirt on my name  
But I rose through the fire, earned my fame  
Now they lookin’ up, prayin’ for light  
But I stayed real, never lost sight  

[Chorus]
Sit down, be humble  
Watch the crown, don’t fumble  
I speak truth, no stumble  
Built this from the rubble  

[Verse]
You flex too hard, but who are you?  
Behind that mask, what’s really true?  
I made mine from scars and sweat  
You still talkin’? Place your bet  

[Bridge]
One mic, one shot, no gimmick  
I live this life, you mimic  

[Chorus]
Sit down, be humble  
Watch the crown, don’t fumble  
I speak truth, no stumble  
Built this from the rubble
