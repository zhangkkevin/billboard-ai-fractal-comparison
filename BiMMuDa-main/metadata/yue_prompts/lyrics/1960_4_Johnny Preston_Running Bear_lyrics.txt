[Verse]
On the banks of a river wide  
Lived a brave with tribal pride  
Across the stream, a maiden fair  
With jet-black eyes and long dark hair  

[Chorus]
Running Bear, he loved so true  
But fate would not let love come through  
They cried across the waters wide  
With hearts so torn they nearly died  

[Bridge]
The river roared and skies grew black  
They swam with no path back  

[Outro]
Now side by side beneath the tide  
Running Bear and his moonlight bride
