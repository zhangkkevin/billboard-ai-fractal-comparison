[Verse]
Every step I take, I feel your name  
Whispers through the silent frame  
You were the light that made me see  
Now all that's left is memory  

[Chorus]
I’ll be missing you each day  
Though you’re gone, you still stay  
In my heart, you never fade  
Your love in every note I’ve played  

[Verse]
The laughs we shared, the roads we walked  
The midnight talks, the dreams we talked  
Now I search the sky for signs  
Of your soul beyond the lines  

[Bridge]
I’d give it all to hold you close  
But I still carry what matters most  

[Outro]
I’ll be missing you always  
Till I see you again someday
