[Verse]
Everybody’s twistin’, now it’s my turn  
Got a brand new beat and a fire that burns  
The DJ’s spinning, crowd’s alive  
Come on and feel that jive  

[Chorus]
It’s mashed potato time  
We’re movin’ to that funky rhyme  
Kick your heels and swing your hips  
Let’s groove with every dip  

[Verse]
You don’t need rhythm, don’t need flair  
Just stomp your feet and toss your hair  
From left to right, now spin around  
Shake it down to the ground  

[Bridge]
Grab a partner, make a line  
We're gonna dance past time  

[Outro]
It’s mashed potato time  
And baby, you’re lookin’ fine
