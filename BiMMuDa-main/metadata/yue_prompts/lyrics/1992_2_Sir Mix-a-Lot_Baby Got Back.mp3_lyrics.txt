[Verse]
Walkin’ through the spot, heads turnin’  
Bass is low, my mind is burnin’  
She’s got style, she’s got sway  
You can’t fake that kind of display  

[Chorus]
She got back, no need to lie  
Catchin’ glances, passin’ by  
Confidence from hip to toe  
And she knows just how to show  

[Verse]
Fashion strong, attitude loud  
She stands out in every crowd  
Moves so smooth, eyes so sharp  
She’s the rhythm, she’s the spark  

[Bridge]
She don’t care what people say  
She’s got pride in every way  

[Outro]
She got back, and she’s proud  
Say it true, say it loud
