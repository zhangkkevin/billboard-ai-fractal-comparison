[Verse]
I was all right for a while  
I could smile and fake the style  
But then you walked into the room  
And tears returned with full bloom  

[Chorus]
Crying, crying in the rain  
You’re the echo in my pain  
I tried to love and let you go  
But tears are all I seem to know  

[Verse]
They say time will mend the heart  
But I’ve been breaking from the start  
Your voice still plays like a song  
A lullaby where I belong  

[Bridge]
Don’t ask me why I fall apart  
You never really left my heart  

[Outro]
Crying, silently for you  
Like I always seem to do
