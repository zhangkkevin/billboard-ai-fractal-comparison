[Verse]
We don’t need your iron rules  
Turning hearts into tools  
No more lies wrapped in disguise  
We see the truth behind your eyes  

[Chorus]
Hey! Leave us kids alone  
We’ve found our minds, we’ve grown  
We’re more than bricks, more than drones  
We’re building voices of our own  

[Verse]
Your walls are cracking at the seams  
You stole our fire, stole our dreams  
But we’re not pawns, we’ve learned to fight  
Our silence now becomes our light  

[Bridge]
Knowledge grows where fear was sown  
We break the chains we used to own  

[Outro]
We’re not just bricks in your wall  
We’re the ones who’ll watch it fall
