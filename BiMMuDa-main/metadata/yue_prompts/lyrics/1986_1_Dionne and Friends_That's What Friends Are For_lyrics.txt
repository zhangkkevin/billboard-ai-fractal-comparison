[Verse]
In the darkest nights, when hope feels thin  
You're the light that pulls me in  
Through every storm, through every tear  
You stand beside me, year to year  

[Chorus]
That’s what friends are for  
To lift you up, to give you more  
Through highs and lows, through thick and thin  
It’s you I trust, where love begins  

[Verse]
You know my heart, you know my past  
Still you’re the one who always lasts  
When laughter fades and troubles rise  
I see the truth behind your eyes  

[Bridge]
The world may change, the road may bend  
But you’ll always be my friend  

[Outro]
That’s what friends are for, it’s true  
I’d do the same for you
