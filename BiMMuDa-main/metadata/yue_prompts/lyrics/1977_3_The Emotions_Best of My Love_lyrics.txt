[Verse]
Every touch, every sigh  
You lift me up, you take me high  
There’s no shadow, no disguise  
Just the sparkle in your eyes  

[Chorus]
You get the best of my love  
Sent from the stars above  
No hesitation, no regret  
You're the one I won’t forget  

[Verse]
When I’m with you, the world stands still  
You turn my silence into thrill  
You take the gray and make it gold  
A love like this is brave and bold  

[Bridge]
You make me sing, you make me dance  
Gave my heart a second chance  

[Outro]
You get the best of everything  
My love, my life, my offering
