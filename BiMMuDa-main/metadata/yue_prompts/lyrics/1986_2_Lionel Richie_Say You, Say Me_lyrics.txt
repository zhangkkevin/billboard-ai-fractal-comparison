[Verse]
Say you, say me  
Let’s not let this moment flee  
We’ve come so far, hearts on display  
Now don’t let silence steal away  

[Chorus]
Say it loud, say it true  
The world fades when I’m with you  
Say you, say me, no disguise  
Let love live behind our eyes  

[Verse]
We walked alone too many nights  
Now here we are beneath the lights  
No need to guess, no need to hide  
Just speak the words we hold inside  

[Bridge]
One voice, one time, one vow  
Say it to me here and now  

[Outro]
Say you, say me, say we  
This love was always meant to be
