[Verse]
As I walk through shadows of my past  
I hear the questions people ask  
Is this the life I chose to lead?  
Or just a world that plants the seed?  

[Chorus]
Livin’ in a gangsta’s paradise  
Where wrong feels right, and truth rolls dice  
Every choice a loaded gun  
And peace is something we outrun  

[Verse]
I’ve seen the pain behind the pride  
Watched too many brothers die  
We hustle hard to just survive  
But sometimes wonder why we’re alive  

[Bridge]
Don’t judge the streets if you ain’t been  
They raised me up, but pulled me in  

[Outro]
Gangsta’s paradise, it’s real  
Where silence is the deal
