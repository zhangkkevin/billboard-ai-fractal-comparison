[Verse]
I fall to pieces when you call my name  
Each word reminds me of the pain  
I try to stand, pretend I’m strong  
But your love lingers all night long  

[Chorus]
I fall to pieces, every time  
Your memory plays in my mind  
You walked away, now here I stay  
Crumbling slowly day by day  

[Verse]
I smile at strangers, laugh on cue  
But inside, I'm torn in two  
No one sees the cracks I hide  
Each piece of me lost with pride  

[Bridge]
Don’t come around unless you care  
I’ve got no more strength to spare  

[Outro]
I fall to pieces, just like before  
Still waiting by that open door
