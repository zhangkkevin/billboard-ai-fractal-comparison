[Intro]
This love, yeah  

[Verse]
I gave her everything I had  
She played my heart, it drove me mad  
She came and went like summer rain  
Left me drowning in my pain  

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll  
I gave too much, she took control  
Now I'm standing in the cold  
This love has taken its toll  

[Verse]
She whispered lies with every kiss  
I should’ve known, I should’ve missed  
But I was blind, and now I see  
She never really wanted me  

[Bridge]
And I still hear her in the dark  
Like a song with a broken heart  

[Chorus]
This love has taken its toll  
I gave too much, she took control  
Now I'm standing in the cold  
This love has taken its toll
