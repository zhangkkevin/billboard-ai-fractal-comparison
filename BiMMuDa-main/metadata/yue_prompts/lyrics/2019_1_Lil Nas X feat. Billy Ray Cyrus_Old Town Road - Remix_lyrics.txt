[Intro]
Yeah, I’m gonna take my horse...  

[Verse]
Ridin’ through the desert sun  
Dusty boots and loaded gun  
City lights don’t call my name  
I’m stickin’ close to cowboy fame  

[Chorus]
I got that old town soul, ridin' slow  
No need to run, just let it roll  
Can’t nobody tell me no  
I ride until the moonlight glows  

[Verse]
Leather jacket, gold grill shine  
I mix the west with modern lines  
This ain’t just a country road  
It’s where the beat and stories go  

[Bridge]
Every mile, a tale to tell  
This rebel don’t need no farewell  

[Chorus]
I got that old town soul, ridin' slow  
No need to run, just let it roll  
Can’t nobody tell me no  
I ride until the moonlight glows
