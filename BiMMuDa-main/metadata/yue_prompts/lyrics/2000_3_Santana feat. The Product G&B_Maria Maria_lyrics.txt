[Intro]  
Maria Maria  
She moves like the wind through the night  

[Verse]  
In the heat of the summer she walks with grace  
Eyes full of fire and a softer face  
The rhythm of the streets in every step  
She knows the world, and no regret  

[Chorus]  
Maria Maria, dancing in the rain  
Loving through the struggle, smiling through the pain  
She’s got a soul like a Spanish song  
A melody where hearts belong  

[Verse]  
Raised on stories and dusty roads  
She sings with a voice nobody owns  
Every word she says is true  
Born of struggle, born of view  

[Bridge]  
She don’t need no crown or stage  
Her beauty’s carved from silent rage  

[Outro]  
Maria Maria  
You’ve got the whole world in your name
