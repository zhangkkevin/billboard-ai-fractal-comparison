[Verse]
It’s been a long road without your face  
I still feel your voice in this empty place  
Every mile we ever crossed  
Still holds the light from what we lost  

[Chorus]
And I’ll see you again someday  
When the hurt fades all away  
We said goodbye, but not the end  
I’ll always wait to see you again  

[Verse]
Shared those dreams, built those nights  
You’re still the spark behind my fights  
Though you’re gone, you’re still right here  
In every laugh, in every tear  

[Bridge]
No more words, just hold me near  
Till we meet again, I’ll keep you here  

[Chorus]
And I’ll see you again someday  
When the hurt fades all away  
We said goodbye, but not the end  
I’ll always wait to see you again
