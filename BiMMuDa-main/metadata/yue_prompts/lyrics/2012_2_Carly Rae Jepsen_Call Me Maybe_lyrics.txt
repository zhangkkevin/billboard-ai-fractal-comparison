[Intro]
Hey, I just met you...  

[Verse]
You threw a glance, I caught my breath  
Like sunlight danced, defying death  
My heart raced fast, my mind went blank  
You're the spark that filled my tank  

[Chorus]
So call me maybe, don't be shy  
This might be love, or just a try  
Gave you my number in the rain  
Hoping you might feel the same  

[Verse]
I didn’t plan, I didn’t think  
But something made me stop and blink  
If you don’t call, I’ll still be fine  
But don’t pretend you missed the sign  

[Bridge]
It’s crazy, yeah, I know it is  
But every great love starts like this  

[Chorus]
So call me maybe, don’t be shy  
This might be love, or just a try  
Gave you my number in the rain  
Hoping you might feel the same
