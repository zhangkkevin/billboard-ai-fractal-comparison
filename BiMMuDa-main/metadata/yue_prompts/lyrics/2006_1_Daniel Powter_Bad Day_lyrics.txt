[Verse]
Where do you go when the world turns gray?  
When everything bright just fades away  
You're walking through rain with no place to be  
But you're still here, still next to me  

[Chorus]
You had a bad day, it's okay  
Let the tears fall, let them stay  
I'll be the sun behind your cloud  
When it gets quiet, I’ll scream loud  

[Verse]
You hide your heart behind a smile  
But I can see it every mile  
No need to lie or play pretend  
Let it break so you can mend  

[Bridge]
You don’t have to win the fight  
Sometimes it's fine just not to be right  

[Chorus]
You had a bad day, it's okay  
Let the tears fall, let them stay  
I'll be the sun behind your cloud  
When it gets quiet, I’ll scream loud  

[Outro]
It's just a bad day, not a bad life
