[Verse]
So many nights I lived in gray  
Lost in silence, turned away  
Then your voice came shining through  
And suddenly, I knew it’s you  

[Chorus]
You light up my life  
Through every shadow, every strife  
With just your touch, I see it clear  
That love like yours is always near  

[Verse]
You gave me hope when I had none  
Turned lonely battles into sun  
The world is bright because you’re here  
You chased away the last of fear  

[Bridge]
Your love's the song I longed to hear  
The only truth that draws me near  

[Outro]
You light up my life each day  
With every word you say
