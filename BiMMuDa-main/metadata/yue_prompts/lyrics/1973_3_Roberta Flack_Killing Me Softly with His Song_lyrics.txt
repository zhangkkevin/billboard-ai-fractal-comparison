[Verse]
He sang a tune so soft and low  
Told stories only hearts could know  
Each word a ribbon round my chest  
A quiet storm I can't suppress  

[Chorus]
Killing me softly with his song  
Every note feels deep and long  
He doesnâ€™t know he holds my pain  
But still I listen once again  

[Verse]
His fingers dance across the keys  
My sorrow rides the gentle breeze  
He weaves the truth I try to hide  
And brings it pouring from inside  

[Bridge]
No spotlight knows my name  
But he sees me just the same  

[Outro]
Killing me softly, line by line  
He stole the hurt and made it mine
