[Intro]
Come on-a my house, come on-a quick...  

[Verse]
I got peaches and a plum or two  
I’ve got a smile just made for you  
Come on-a baby, don’t be shy  
My love is fresh and oven-fried  

[Chorus]
Come on-a my house, take a bite  
I’ll treat you good both day and night  
Sugar and spice and maybe wine  
Let’s share a taste, then call it mine  

[Bridge]
I’ve got charm and candied fruit  
All I’m missin’ now is you  

[Outro]
Come on-a my house, don’t be late  
This lovin’ dish is on your plate
