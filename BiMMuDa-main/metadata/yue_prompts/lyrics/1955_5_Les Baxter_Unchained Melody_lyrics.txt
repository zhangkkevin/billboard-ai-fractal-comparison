[Intro]  
Untethered heart...  
I call to you...  

[Verse]  
Oh my love, my only  
The night is long and cold  
I’ve waited here in silence  
With dreams I used to hold  

[Chorus]  
Come back and break the stillness  
Unchain the time we lost  
I’ll pay the price for longing  
No matter what the cost  

[Verse]  
I hear your voice in shadows  
A whisper in the rain  
I reach across the distance  
And feel your touch again  

[Bridge]  
If love can cross the heavens  
Then mine will find your soul  
Though miles and years divide us  
You’re what still makes me whole  

[Outro]  
Untethered heart, come home to me  
Set this silence free  
I need your love  
I need your love  
Come back and carry me
