[Verse]
We said some things we can’t erase  
But I still long to see your face  
I played the fool, I pushed away  
Now I pray for one more day  

[Chorus]
On bended knee, I plead  
You’re the only heart I need  
I’ll rewrite the words we said  
And bring this love back from the dead  

[Verse]
I took for granted what was true  
Now every night, I dream of you  
Don’t walk away, don’t close that door  
I swear I won’t hurt you anymore  

[Bridge]
Let me show what love can be  
If you put your trust in me  

[Outro]
On bended knee, I cry  
For one last chance before goodbye
