[Verse]
Who's walkin' down the street so fine?  
Spinnin’ like a breeze through time  
Hair like sunlight, heart so free  
Windy’s all I want to see  

[Chorus]
Windy dances where she goes  
Lifts the clouds and melts the snows  
With a laugh she shifts the air  
Leaves a sparkle everywhere  

[Verse]
She don’t speak, she sings instead  
With every glance, my doubts are shed  
She’s the music, she’s the light  
Windy makes the world feel right  

[Bridge]
Even shadows disappear  
When Windy’s whispering near  

[Outro]
Windy, won’t you stay with me?  
You’re the calm and energy
