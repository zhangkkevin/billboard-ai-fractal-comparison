[Verse]
Take a look at me now  
I’m standing here, I don’t know how  
You left a space I can’t erase  
A missing voice, a vanished face  

[Chorus]
Against all odds, I hoped you’d stay  
But you turned and walked away  
I gave you more than I could show  
Now I face this world alone  

[Verse]
The days go by but don’t feel new  
Every corner still has you  
You said goodbye, but not goodbye  
Your name still echoes in my sky  

[Bridge]
If fate had written different lines  
Would we still be crossing signs?  

[Outro]
Take a look at me now  
Still waiting, though I don’t know how
