[Verse]
When the night is dark and cold  
And there’s no one left to hold  
I just close my eyes and see  
You’re still here, right next to me  

[Chorus]
All I have to do is dream  
Feel your kiss, or hear you sing  
I may be far, but you’re so near  
When I dream, you're always here  

[Verse]
I can make the rainbows shine  
Turn back time and make you mine  
There’s no limit to what I feel  
In my dreams, it’s all so real  

[Bridge]
Daylight fades but I don’t mind  
I’ve got your love locked in my mind  

[Outro]
All I have to do is dream  
And you're mine in every scene
