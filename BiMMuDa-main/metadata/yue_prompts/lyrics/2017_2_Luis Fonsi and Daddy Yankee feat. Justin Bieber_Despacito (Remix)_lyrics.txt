[Verse]
Slow like waves across the sand  
You take my heart with just one hand  
Whispers fall like velvet rain  
And I forget all of the pain  

[Chorus]
Despacito, pull me close  
Every breath, a holy ghost  
Let me trace your every line  
Take our time, make you mine  

[Verse]
Heat and rhythm, skin to skin  
A paradise we hold within  
One more kiss, donâ€™t let me go  
Teach me love, teach me slow  

[Bridge]
Step by step, we find the light  
Dancing softly through the night  

[Chorus]
Despacito, pull me close  
Every breath, a holy ghost  
Let me trace your every line  
Take our time, make you mine
