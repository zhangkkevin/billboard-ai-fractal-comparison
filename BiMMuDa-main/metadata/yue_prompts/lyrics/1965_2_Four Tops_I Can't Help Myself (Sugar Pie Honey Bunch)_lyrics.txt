[Verse]
Sugar pie, honey bunch  
You’re the reason I skip lunch  
Can’t think straight, can’t stay cool  
Every time, I act a fool  

[Chorus]
I can’t help myself  
You're my weakness and my wealth  
You got me under your spell  
And I can’t break it, can’t you tell?  

[Verse]
I try to walk away each time  
But your voice just rewinds my mind  
No other girl makes me feel  
The kind of love that feels so real  

[Bridge]
Don’t blame me if I stay  
Your sweet touch leads the way  

[Outro]
Sugar pie, honey bunch  
You’ve got me in your clutch
