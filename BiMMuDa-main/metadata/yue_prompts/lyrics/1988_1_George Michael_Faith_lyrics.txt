[Verse]
Well I guess it would be nice  
If love was just a roll of dice  
But I’ve learned it’s more than chance  
You gotta give the heart a dance  

[Chorus]
You gotta have faith, that’s what I need  
To trust in love and let it lead  
Even when the nights are long  
I’ll keep believing, keep me strong  

[Verse]
I’ve been burned and I’ve been bruised  
But now I choose not to lose  
I need a love that holds me tight  
Not just someone for the night  

[Bridge]
I won’t fall for pretty lies  
I want truth behind the eyes  

[Outro]
You gotta have faith to try again  
And I’m ready to begin
