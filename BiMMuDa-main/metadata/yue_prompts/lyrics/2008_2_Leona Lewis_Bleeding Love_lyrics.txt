[Verse]
Closed off from love, I never knew  
What it could feel like loving you  
Now I bleed with every breath  
A love too deep to forget  

[Chorus]
You cut me open and I keep bleeding  
My heart’s still here, still believing  
Though the pain is loud enough  
I still drown in this love  

[Verse]
Tried to hide, tried to run  
But I can’t undo what’s begun  
Even if it tears me apart  
You’ll always live inside my heart  

[Bridge]
Every tear that I’ve cried  
Is just proof I’ve tried  

[Chorus]
You cut me open and I keep bleeding  
My heart’s still here, still believing  
Though the pain is loud enough  
I still drown in this love  

[Outro]
I keep bleeding love
