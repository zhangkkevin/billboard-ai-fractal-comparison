[Verse]
I want to stand with you on mountains  
I want to feel your breath in rain  
I want to hold you close forever  
And never speak your name in vain  

[Chorus]
Truly, madly, deeply I  
Will be yours until I die  
You’re the rhythm in my sleep  
The sacred soul I keep  

[Verse]
When I’m lost, you bring me back  
You’re the compass I never lack  
I’ll be the earth beneath your feet  
And every silence you repeat  

[Bridge]
This love won’t fade, it only grows  
Deeper than the world knows  

[Outro]
Truly, madly, through the storm  
Your love keeps my spirit warm
