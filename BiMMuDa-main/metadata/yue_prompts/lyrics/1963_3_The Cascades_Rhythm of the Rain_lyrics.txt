[Verse]
Listen to the rhythm of the rain  
Telling me I’ll never love again  
It taps the glass with aching sound  
Since you’re no longer around  

[Chorus]
The rhythm of the rain  
Knows my sorrow, knows my pain  
It cries with me each night  
In soft and silver light  

[Verse]
I told the sky about your name  
How your love left like the flame  
It weeps with me from dusk to dawn  
And I keep moving on  

[Bridge]
Raindrops whisper what I feel  
A love once true, a loss so real  

[Outro]
Listen to the rhythm of the rain  
It knows I won’t be whole again
