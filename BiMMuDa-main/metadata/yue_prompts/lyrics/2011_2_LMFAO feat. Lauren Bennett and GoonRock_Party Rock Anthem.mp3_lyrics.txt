[Intro]
Party rock is in the house tonight...  

[Verse]
Bass drops hard, we lose control  
Glasses up, we hit the goal  
Every body in the zone  
Shufflin’ like we own the throne  

[Chorus]
Party rock, we don't sleep  
We go hard and dive so deep  
Feel that beat in every bone  
Tonight we claim this place our own  

[Verse]
Laser lights and wild sound  
We shake the floor, we break the ground  
This is more than just a night  
It’s neon dreams and flashing light  

[Bridge]
Hands up high, don’t let go  
We turn it up and steal the show  

[Chorus]
Party rock, we don't sleep  
We go hard and dive so deep  
Feel that beat in every bone  
Tonight we claim this place our own
