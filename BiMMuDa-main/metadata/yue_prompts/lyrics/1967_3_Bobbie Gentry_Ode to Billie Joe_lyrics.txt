[Verse]
It was the third of June, another sleepy day  
Dust on the porch, the sky all gray  
Mama cooking, radio hums  
Talkin’ ‘bout the bridge and what’s become  

[Chorus]
Ode to Billie Joe, a tale of loss  
A boy who vanished, paid the cost  
No one said just what he feared  
But we all wept when he disappeared  

[Verse]
Pass the biscuits, change the tune  
But that silence filled the room  
We all pretend we didn’t see  
What Billie Joe meant to me  

[Bridge]
Some secrets float like ghostly rain  
Fallin’ soft on windowpanes  

[Outro]
Ode to Billie Joe remains  
A whisper through forgotten names
