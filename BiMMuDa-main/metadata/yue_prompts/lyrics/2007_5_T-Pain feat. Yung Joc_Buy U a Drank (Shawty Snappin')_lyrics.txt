[Intro]
Snap ya fingers, do the step  

[Verse]
Shawty in the club, lookin’ real fine  
I’m just tryin’ to make you mine  
Let me buy you somethin’ nice  
Sweet and slow like paradise  

[Chorus]
Can I buy u a drank?  
Tell me what you think  
You and me, let’s ride  
On this beat tonight  

[Verse]
We vibin’, no need to rush  
Feelin' good off this crush  
Snap your fingers, take it slow  
Let’s see where this could go  

[Bridge]
From the floor to the top  
We don’t stop when the beat drop  

[Chorus]
Can I buy u a drank?  
Tell me what you think  
You and me, let’s ride  
On this beat tonight
