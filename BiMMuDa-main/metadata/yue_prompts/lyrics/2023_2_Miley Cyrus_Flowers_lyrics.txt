[Verse]
I stood alone beneath the sky  
No one there to hear me cry  
But in that silence, I grew strong  
Found the place where I belong  

[Chorus]
I can buy myself flowers  
Walk through rain and golden hours  
Write my name in skies above  
Don’t need a man to feel love  

[Verse]
You thought I’d break when you were gone  
But I’ve been blooming all along  
Took the pain, I made it art  
Now I'm whole with my own heart  

[Bridge]
You were thunder, I’m the storm  
And now I dance in my new form  

[Outro]
I can love me just the same  
Without your fire, without your flame
