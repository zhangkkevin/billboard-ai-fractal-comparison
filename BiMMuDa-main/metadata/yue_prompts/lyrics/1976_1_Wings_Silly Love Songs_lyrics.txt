[Verse]
You said the world has had enough  
Of all this sugar-coated stuff  
But I believe in melodies  
That bring us down to bended knees  

[Chorus]
What's wrong with silly love songs?  
They’ve kept me warm when nights were long  
I’d sing them loud, I’d sing them true  
If it means I can sing to you  

[Verse]
I’ve seen the cynics roll their eyes  
But I’d rather chase butterflies  
With every note and foolish line  
I find a way to make you mine  

[Bridge]
So let them laugh, let them tease  
I’ll write you love songs till I cease  

[Outro]
What’s wrong with singing how I feel?  
Silly or not, this love is real
