[Verse]
My love, there’s no start or end  
You're my forever, my closest friend  
From morning light to midnight stars  
I carry you, no matter how far  

[Chorus]
You're my endless love  
A gift sent from above  
In every breath, in every sigh  
You're the reason I survive  

[Verse]
We walk through time, hand in hand  
On shifting seas, on golden sand  
No test too hard, no night too long  
With you, I’ve found where I belong  

[Bridge]
No one else could take your place  
You’re my shelter, my saving grace  

[Outro]
You're my endless love  
Forever’s not enough
