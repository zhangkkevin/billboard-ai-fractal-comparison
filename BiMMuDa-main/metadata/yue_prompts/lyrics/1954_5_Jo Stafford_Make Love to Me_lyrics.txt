[Verse]
Take me in your arms tonight  
Hold me ‘til the morning light  
Forget the world, just you and me  
Darlin’, make love to me  

[Chorus]
Make love to me, slow and sweet  
With every breath and every beat  
Let the stars above us shine  
While your heart says it’s mine  

[Verse]
Dance me through the night’s embrace  
With every kiss, a warm new place  
No words are needed, can’t you see?  
Just make love to me  

[Bridge]
No need for diamonds, silk or wine  
Just your hands, and eyes that shine  

[Outro]
So let the night be all we need  
Come make love to me indeed
