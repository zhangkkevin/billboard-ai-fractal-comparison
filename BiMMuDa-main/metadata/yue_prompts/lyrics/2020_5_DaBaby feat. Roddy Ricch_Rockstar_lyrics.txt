[Verse]
Walk through fire, I won’t burn  
As long as you say you’ll return  
I’d hold the sky in folded hands  
If that’s the price to be your man  

[Chorus]
I adore you, that’s the truth  
Every step, I follow you  
You don’t have to say a thing  
You’re the peace the stars would bring  

[Verse]
You’re the calm beneath my wave  
A secret that I’ll always save  
And when the world forgets to care  
I’ll be the one who’s always there  

[Bridge]
You don’t even need to try  
You’re the reason I still fly  

[Chorus]
I adore you, that’s the truth  
Every step, I follow you  
You don’t have to say a thing  
You’re the peace the stars would bring
