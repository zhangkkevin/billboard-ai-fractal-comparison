[Verse]
Why you always act so cold?  
One minute fire, next you fold  
I’m tryna ride, you hit the brakes  
Then blame me for your mistakes  

[Chorus]
Why you always in a mood?  
Switchin’ like you’re in a feud  
Can’t we just vibe, keep it real?  
Instead of playin’ how you feel  

[Verse]
You talk in riddles, laugh then sigh  
Say you're done, but never try  
I want love, not games and pride  
Tell me if you're on my side  

[Bridge]
If it’s real, then say it loud  
Or let me go and fade the sound  

[Chorus]
Why you always in a mood?  
Switchin’ like you’re in a feud  
Can’t we just vibe, keep it real?  
Instead of playin’ how you feel
