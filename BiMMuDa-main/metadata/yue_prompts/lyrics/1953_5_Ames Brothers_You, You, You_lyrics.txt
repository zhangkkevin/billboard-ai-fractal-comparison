[Verse]
You, you, you are all I need  
The rhythm in my every beat  
When I wake or when I dream  
Youâ€™re the sparkle in my gleam  

[Chorus]
You, you, you light up the night  
Turn the wrongs into the right  
You, you, you, I can't deny  
You're my moon, my star, my sky  

[Verse]
From morning kiss to evening song  
With you is where I feel I belong  
Laughter rings where once was blue  
All because I found you  

[Bridge]
Let the world just spin away  
As long as you're mine every day  

[Outro]
You, you, you, my sweetest sound  
With you, true love is always found
