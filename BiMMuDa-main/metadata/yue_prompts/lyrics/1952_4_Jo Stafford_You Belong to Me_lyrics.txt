[Verse]
See the pyramids along the Nile  
But know I’m thinking all the while  
No matter where your heart may roam  
You belong to me, come home  

[Chorus]
You belong to me, that’s true  
From distant lands to skies of blue  
Though you travel far and wide  
You are always by my side  

[Verse]
Count the stars above Bombay  
But don’t forget I’m here each day  
Writing songs you’ll never hear  
Wishing you were near  

[Bridge]
Even if we’re worlds apart  
You still live inside my heart  

[Chorus]
You belong to me, that’s true  
From distant lands to skies of blue  
Though you travel far and wide  
You are always by my side
