[Verse]
You gave me more than I deserved  
You brought me hope with every word  
Now here we stand, no room for doubt  
There’s no reason to walk out  

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up  
Never gonna break your trust  
I’ll be here through every storm  
Loving you in every form  

[Verse]
Others came, but none could stay  
You’re the one who lit my way  
So let the world turn if it must  
I’ve got your hand, I’ve got your trust  

[Bridge]
No secrets, no more games  
Just two hearts that feel the same  

[Outro]
Never gonna let you go  
You're the one I need to know
