[Verse]
Pretty woman, walkin’ by  
Caught me with a single sigh  
Eyes like fire, lips like wine  
You got me dreamin’ overtime  

[Chorus]
Oh, pretty woman, can’t you see?  
You’re the one who sets me free  
Just one glance, and now I know  
You’re the star in every show  

[Verse]
Don’t pass me like a summer breeze  
Come say hello, come put me at ease  
You’ve got that look, that mystery  
And darlin’, you belong with me  

[Bridge]
Even angels stop and stare  
When you walk with style and flair  

[Outro]
Oh, pretty woman, say you will  
Stay with me and time stands still
