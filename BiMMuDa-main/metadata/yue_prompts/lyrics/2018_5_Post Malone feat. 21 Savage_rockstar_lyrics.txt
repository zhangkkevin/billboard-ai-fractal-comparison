[Verse]
Woke up in another dream  
Fast life, lights, and dopamine  
People change like dollar signs  
But I still hustle, still grind  

[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar in my skin  
Fallin’ out, just to win  
Every scar and every fight  
Made me glow beneath the night  

[Verse]
Party wild, but feel alone  
Gold and glass can’t build a home  
But I play it like a king  
For the pain, I let it sing  

[Bridge]
No one sees the fall from grace  
Behind these shades, I hide my face  

[Chorus]
I'm a rockstar in my skin  
Fallin’ out, just to win  
Every scar and every fight  
Made me glow beneath the night
