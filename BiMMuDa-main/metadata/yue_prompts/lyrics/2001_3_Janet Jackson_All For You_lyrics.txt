[Intro]
Yeah, come on  
It’s all for you, baby  

[Verse]
I see you looking, don’t be shy  
This groove’s electric, don’t ask why  
We’re movin’ through the neon light  
Let’s dance until we lose the night  

[Chorus]
It’s all for you, every step and every move  
Got nothin’ to lose, I’m feelin’ the groove  
You’re all I see, just me and you  
Tonight it’s all, all for you  

[Verse]
Drop the past, let’s raise the heat  
You’re the reason for this beat  
Take my hand, don’t be afraid  
I’m your rhythm, you’re my shade  

[Bridge]
No one else is in this room  
Let the night erase the rules  

[Chorus]
It’s all for you, every step and every move  
Got nothin’ to lose, I’m feelin’ the groove  
You’re all I see, just me and you  
Tonight it’s all, all for you  

[Outro]
Yeah, just for you
