[Verse]
I can’t stop loving you, no matter how I try  
Your memory lingers like the endless sky  
The years go by, but your face stays the same  
And every breath I take calls your name  

[Chorus]
I can’t stop loving you  
Though my heart breaks right in two  
I made up my mind to live in the past  
Where our love would always last  

[Verse]
I tried to move on, I tried to forget  
But your voice is a song I haven’t left yet  
I walk through days in a painted smile  
But miss you more with every mile  

[Bridge]
They say let go, but I hold tight  
To all the love you brought to light  

[Outro]
I can’t stop loving you  
No matter what I do
