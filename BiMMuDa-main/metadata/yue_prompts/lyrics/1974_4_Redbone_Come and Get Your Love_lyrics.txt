[Verse]
Hey now, what’s the matter with your heart?  
You’ve been hiding, falling apart  
Come step into this groove with me  
Let go, baby, and just be free  

[Chorus]
Come and get your love  
You don’t have to push or shove  
I’ve got enough to go around  
Let’s lift this love up off the ground  

[Verse]
You don’t need makeup or disguise  
I see the fire behind your eyes  
So stop pretending you don’t feel  
This beat is strong, this love is real  

[Bridge]
Don’t wait, don’t hesitate  
We’ve got the rhythm, now don’t be late  

[Outro]
Come and get your love tonight  
We’ll dance until the morning light
