[Verse]
They say the moon is far away  
But with your love, it’s close today  
Your voice, a melody so true  
Brings heaven just a step from you  

[Chorus]
How high the moon, how deep the blue  
Still not as far as I’d go for you  
Even stars can’t shine so bright  
As loving you each gentle night  

[Bridge]
Your laugh’s the rhythm I adore  
Each kiss leaves me wanting more  

[Outro]
So let’s just float beyond the sky  
With you, I feel I’ll always fly
