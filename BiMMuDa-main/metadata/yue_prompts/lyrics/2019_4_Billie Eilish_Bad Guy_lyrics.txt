[Verse]
I wear my smile just like a blade  
Say the things you're all afraid  
I don’t follow, I don’t ask  
I wear rebellion like a mask  

[Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, can’t deny  
Twist the rules and let them fly  
I don’t blink, I don’t pretend  
I play the game and break the end  

[Verse]
Soft voice, sharp mind  
Every word a warning sign  
You think you’ve read me, but you’re blind  
I’m ten steps ahead of time  

[Bridge]
Don’t mistake my quiet tone  
I rewrite the world alone  

[Chorus]
I'm the bad guy, can’t deny  
Twist the rules and let them fly  
I don’t blink, I don’t pretend  
I play the game and break the end
