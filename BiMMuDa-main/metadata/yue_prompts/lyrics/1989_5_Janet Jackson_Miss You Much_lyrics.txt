[Verse]
You walked away, the door went cold  
And left behind a love untold  
I tried to laugh, I tried to smile  
But I’ve been aching all the while  

[Chorus]
Miss you much, it’s true  
Every breath reminds me of you  
The days are long, the nights are rough  
No one else is ever enough  

[Verse]
I see your shadow down the hall  
Still waiting for your midnight call  
My friends say time will make me heal  
But they don’t know how deep I feel  

[Bridge]
If you came back, just for a touch  
You’d know why I miss you much  

[Outro]
Miss you much, can't let go  
You're the love I’ll always know
