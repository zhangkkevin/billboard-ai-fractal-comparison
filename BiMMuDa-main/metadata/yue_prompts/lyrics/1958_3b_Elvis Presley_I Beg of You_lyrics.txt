[Verse]
I beg of you, don’t say goodbye  
Let me be your lullaby  
In your eyes I see my fate  
I’m knockin’, darlin’, at your gate  

[Chorus]
I beg of you, take my hand  
Let me help you understand  
No gold or fame, just love so true  
All I want is you  

[Verse]
Don’t make me dream of love alone  
Don’t turn my heart to stone  
I’ll sing your name through rain and blue  
If you’ll just say, “I do”  

[Bridge]
I’d give you stars and all I’ve got  
But just your smile would mean a lot  

[Outro]
So darlin’, please, I beg of you  
Say our love is true
