[Verse]
Do that to me one more time  
Touch my heart and make it rhyme  
You know the way to pull me near  
Whisper love I long to hear  

[Chorus]
Do that to me once again  
Let me feel like I did then  
Every kiss, a sacred vow  
I need your magic here and now  

[Verse]
The way you hold me in the night  
Turns every shadow into light  
You make the stillness start to sing  
With just the warmth your hands can bring  

[Bridge]
One more time wonâ€™t be enough  
To show the depth of all this love  

[Outro]
So do that to me once again  
Let forever now begin
