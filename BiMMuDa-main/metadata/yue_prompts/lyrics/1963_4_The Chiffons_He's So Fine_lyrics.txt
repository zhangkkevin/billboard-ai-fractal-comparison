[Verse]
He walks by and hearts all flutter  
Girls lean close and shyly mutter  
He’s got that smile, that easy air  
And not a soul can help but stare  

[Chorus]
He’s so fine, I can’t ignore  
That boy’s what I’ve been waiting for  
Every step he takes, I sigh  
He don’t even have to try  

[Verse]
The way he laughs, the way he stands  
I dream of holding both his hands  
But I’m too scared to say hello  
So I just watch him come and go  

[Bridge]
If he knew how much I care  
Would he turn or just stare?  

[Outro]
He’s so fine, I hope someday  
He’ll turn around and look my way
