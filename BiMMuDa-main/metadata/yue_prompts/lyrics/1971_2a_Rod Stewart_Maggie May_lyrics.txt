[Verse]
Wake up, Maggie, I think I’ve said
Too much with silence, not enough with tread
You took my heart, then gave it back
But now I’m standing on the track

[Chorus]
Maggie May, I played the fool
Thought I was wise, thought I was cool
But now I see you had your say
While I watched time drift away

[Verse]
I packed my things, I left your bed
Your perfume lingers in my head
The records spin but I can’t hear
A voice so soft, then disappeared

[Bridge]
You broke the boy, but made the man
In ways I’ll never understand

[Outro]
Maggie May, this is goodbye
But I won’t forget your sky
