[Verse]
Used to be the girl next door  
Now she's lighting up the store  
Caught me by surprise, I swear  
When I saw her picture there  

[Chorus]
My angel is a centerfold  
Truth untold, a story bold  
She changed the rules, flipped the page  
Turned my past into a stage  

[Verse]
We shared dreams and playground games  
Now she's dancing under lights and fame  
I'm stuck in time, she's moving fast  
And I'm just a ghost from her past  

[Bridge]
I don’t blame her for the show  
But part of me can’t let it go  

[Outro]
My sweet surprise in glossy fold  
Still warms my heart, though she’s gone cold
