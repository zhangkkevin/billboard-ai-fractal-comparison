[Verse]
I wake up hoping you're still here  
But you're a dream that disappears  
You say you love me, then you run  
Leave me burning like the sun  

[Chorus]
I want you to stay, don’t let go  
I need you more than you could know  
You're the song I play on loop  
The only thing that pulls me through  

[Verse]
You come and go just like the tide  
And I can’t seem to change your mind  
But when you're gone, it’s hard to breathe  
You're the air I always need  

[Bridge]
Say you’ll try, say you care  
Say you’ll meet me anywhere  

[Chorus]
I want you to stay, don’t let go  
I need you more than you could know  
You're the song I play on loop  
The only thing that pulls me through
