[Verse]
Soft and slow, it pulls you near  
Whispers truth you didn’t hear  
Takes your breath, steals your time  
Wraps you up like sweetest wine  

[Chorus]
That’s the way love goes

How deep it runs, how wide it spreads  
But once it starts, it never ends  

[Verse]
A look, a smile, and it begins  
You're tangled up in all your sins  
But somehow still you don’t regret  
It’s the sweetest danger yet  

[Bridge]
You can’t fight what’s in your veins  
Love will always break the chains  

[Outro]
That’s the way love flows  
Soft and wild, and it shows
