[Verse]
I was blind, couldn’t see the way  
Every step just led astray  
But then you came, and skies were clear  
The truth was always waiting near  

[Chorus]
I saw the sign, and it opened my eyes  
Told me where my future lies  
No more games, no more disguise  
Now I finally realize  

[Verse]
You broke the chain, you lit the spark  
Turned the shadows into art  
I won’t look back, I’ve found my song  
Where I belong, where I’ve been strong  

[Bridge]
The road was dark, but now it’s lit  
With every truth I used to quit  

[Outro]
I saw the sign, and now I know  
It's time to rise, it's time to grow
