[Verse]
Gold on my chain, but your smile shines more  
Penthouse dreams, champagne on the floor  
You got style, I got plans  
Let’s take a trip, just hold my hand  

[Chorus]
That’s what I like, you and me  
Silk and soul, just feelin’ free  
From New York lights to tropic skies  
I give you truth, no disguise  

[Verse]
Strawberries and midnight laughs  
You take the lead, I’ll watch your path  
Whatever you want, it’s yours to take  
No rules tonight, no hearts to break  

[Bridge]
We don’t need the world to see  
As long as you believe in me  

[Chorus]
That’s what I like, you and me  
Silk and soul, just feelin’ free  
From New York lights to tropic skies  
I give you truth, no disguise
