[Intro]  
Yeah! Get up, get down—feel it now!  

[Verse]  
Bass is pumpin’, lights are flashin’  
Crowd is jumpin’, hearts are crashin’  
Feel the rhythm in your spine  
Let that body break the line  

[Chorus]  
Gonna make you sweat, don’t fight the groove  
Gonna shake your soul, get you in the mood  
Gonna make you move, gonna turn it up  
Till the beat won’t stop, till we’ve had enough  

[Verse]  
Hands up high, the floor is burnin’  
Turn it loose, no more returnin’  
Drop the stress, just let it slide  
Tonight we’re living amplified  

[Bridge]  
It’s a fever, it’s a fire  
Climbin’ high, takin’ you higher  

[Outro]  
Gonna make you sweat, yeah that’s the plan  
Feel the rhythm, feel the jam!
