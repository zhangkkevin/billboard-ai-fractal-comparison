[Verse]
My prayer is whispered to the skies  
With hands held still and closing eyes  
I send your name with every plea  
That you’ll return to only me  

[Chorus]
My prayer, through stars it flies  
To light your path and clear the skies  
If heaven hears, then let it be  
You’ll come back home to me  

[Verse]
Each night I speak it soft and low  
Like lullabies from long ago  
It’s all I have, this quiet sound  
To bring your love back around  

[Bridge]
The world may change, the winds may blow  
But not the way I love you so  

[Outro]
My prayer, it floats on wings of grace  
Until I see your face
