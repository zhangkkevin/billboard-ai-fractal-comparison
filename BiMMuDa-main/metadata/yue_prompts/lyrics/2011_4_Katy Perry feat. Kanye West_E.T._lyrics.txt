[Verse]
You don’t speak, but I hear your sound  
A voice from stars, so deep, profound  
You pull me close, defy the time  
A love unknown, but so divine  

[Chorus]
You're from another world  
I feel the pull, I feel the swirl  
You crash like light into my soul  
Now I’m not in control  

[Verse]
Your touch is sharp, electric bright  
I dream of you in cosmic light  
Strange and beautiful, surreal  
Only you can make me feel  

[Bridge]
Alien heart, magnetic draw  
You break the rules, rewrite the law  

[Chorus]
You're from another world  
I feel the pull, I feel the swirl  
You crash like light into my soul  
Now I’m not in control
