[Verse]
I look into your eyes and see  
The only truth that sets me free  
The world may shift, the winds may change  
But I know you’ll always stay  

[Chorus]
No one, no one  
Can get in the way of what I feel  
No fear, no doubt  
Can shake the love that’s real  

[Verse]
We’ve faced the dark, we’ve seen the storm  
But love like this can still stay warm  
You hold my hand, I find my peace  
This kind of love will never cease  

[Bridge]
Through the chaos, you remain  
Like steady fire through the rain  

[Chorus]
No one, no one  
Can get in the way of what I feel  
No fear, no doubt  
Can shake the love that’s real  

[Outro]
You and me
