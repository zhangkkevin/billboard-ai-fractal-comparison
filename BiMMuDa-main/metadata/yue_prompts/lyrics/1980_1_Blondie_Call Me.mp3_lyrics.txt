[Verse]
When the lights go down and I feel the chill  
I hear your voice and I get that thrill  
You don't need to say too much  
One word and I’m feeling your touch  

[Chorus]
Call me, anytime, day or night  
I’ll come running through the light  
Whisper soft or scream it loud  
I’ll find you in the crowd  

[Verse]
The city's loud, but I hear your tone  
A secret ring, I’m not alone  
You say the word, and I’m alive  
Just one call and I arrive  

[Bridge]
Don’t let the silence break our flame  
Say my name, I’ll do the same  

[Outro]
Call me, no matter where  
I’ll be yours, I’ll be there
