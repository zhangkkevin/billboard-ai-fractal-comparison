[Verse]
Tonight we're wild, we leave the past  
We light this match, make moments last  
Our hearts may break, but not tonight  
We burn like stars in morning light  

[Chorus]
We are young, and we are fire  
Chasing echoes, climbing higher  
Take my hand and run away  
We’ll own the night and break the day  

[Verse]
Mistakes behind us like old songs  
We find our place where we belong  
One more drink, one more fight  
But love redeems us every night  

[Bridge]
Let the ceilings fall away  
Let tomorrow fade to gray  

[Chorus]
We are young, and we are fire  
Chasing echoes, climbing higher  
Take my hand and run away  
We’ll own the night and break the day
