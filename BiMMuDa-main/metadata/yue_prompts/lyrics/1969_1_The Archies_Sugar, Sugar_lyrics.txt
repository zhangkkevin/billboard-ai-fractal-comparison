[Verse]
Sugar, sugar, you taste so sweet  
With every kiss, you bring the heat  
You're the candy in my jar  
The sweetest thing by far  

[Chorus]
Sugar, you light me up  
You’re my honey, you fill my cup  
Can’t get enough of your love  
You fit me like a velvet glove  

[Verse]
You're the buzz I crave each day  
The sunshine that don’t go away  
When I feel your sugar high  
All my worries say goodbye  

[Bridge]
Pour your love right into me  
Like syrup in my morning tea  

[Outro]
Sugar, sugar, stay awhile  
You’re the reason I smile
