[Verse]
On a summer day, we carved our names  
In shifting sands and youthful games  
But tides rolled in, and washed away  
The promises we made that day  

[Chorus]
Love letters in the sand  
Fade like dreams you tried to plan  
Your words once held me near  
Now they disappear  

[Verse]
You said forever, soft and sweet  
But silence came with aching feet  
Now every wave reminds my heart  
That love can drift and fall apart  

[Bridge]
I trace your name where shells have lain  
But all I find is loss and rain  

[Outro]
Love letters in the sand  
Were written by a fleeting hand
