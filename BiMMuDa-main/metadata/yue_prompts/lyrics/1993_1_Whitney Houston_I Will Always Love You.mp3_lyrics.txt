[Verse]
If I should stay, I’d only cry  
So I walk away, though I don’t know why  
Love like ours, it's rare and true  
And I will always carry you  

[Chorus]
I will always love you  
No matter what we’ve been through  
Even as I say goodbye  
You’re still the light in my sky  

[Verse]
We had our time, and it was gold  
But some stories can’t be told  
In chapters we try to hold  
So I let go, but not my soul  

[Bridge]
Bittersweet, yet full of grace  
Your memory, a warm embrace  

[Outro]
I will always love you still  
Beyond goodbye, beyond the hill
