[Verse]
Even when I’m with her, I think of you  
Can’t help the things we used to do  
I know it's wrong, I feel the flame  
But when you call, I feel the same  

[Chorus]
It’s a dilemma, baby, what can I do?  
I got love for her, but I’m drawn to you  
Every time I try to walk away  
You say the words that make me stay  

[Verse]
You’re in my dreams, you’re in my phone  
Even when I’m not alone  
This ain’t fair, this ain’t clean  
But you and I, we got this thing  

[Bridge]
And even if I try to choose  
I know it’s me I’m gonna lose  

[Chorus]
It’s a dilemma, baby, what can I do?  
I got love for her, but I’m drawn to you  
Every time I try to walk away  
You say the words that make me stay
