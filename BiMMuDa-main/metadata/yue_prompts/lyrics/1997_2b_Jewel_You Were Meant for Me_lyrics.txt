[Verse]  
I pour my coffee, tie my shoes  
But mornings always bring the blues  
The way you laughed still haunts my mind  
Like a clock I can’t rewind  

[Chorus]  
You were meant for me, I know it's true  
In every shadow, I still see you  
I try to move, I try to be  
But nothing fits like you and me  

[Verse]  
I hear our song on distant streets  
Where we once danced with careless feet  
Now I walk alone in time  
Chasing echoes of your rhyme  

[Bridge]  
I guess fate played its hand too soon  
Left me talking to the moon  

[Outro]  
You were meant for me, can’t you see?  
You're the piece that’s missing from me
