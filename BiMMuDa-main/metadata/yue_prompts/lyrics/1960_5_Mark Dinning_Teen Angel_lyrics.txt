[Verse]
Teen angel, can you hear me cry?  
You left so fast, no last goodbye  
The stars were out that fatal night  
When you drove off into the light  

[Chorus]
Teen angel, gone too soon  
Underneath the silver moon  
You saved my heart and paid the cost  
Now I must live with what I lost  

[Bridge]
I see your face in every dream  
Your voice returns like soft moonbeams  

[Outro]
Teen angel, my heart still bleeds  
For the girl who met my needs
