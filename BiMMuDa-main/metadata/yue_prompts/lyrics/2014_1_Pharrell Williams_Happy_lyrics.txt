[Verse]
Sunlight dancing on my face  
Every shadow finds its place  
No more waiting for the spark  
I've got joy inside my heart  

[Chorus]
Because I’m happy, can’t explain  
Like a rhythm in the rain  
Hands up high, just let it be  
This is how it feels to be free  

[Verse]
Don’t need riches, don’t need fame  
Just that feeling I can’t name  
It’s a groove that never ends  
Smiling with the world again  

[Bridge]
If you feel it, clap along  
Like your heart just wrote this song  

[Chorus]
Because I’m happy, can’t explain  
Like a rhythm in the rain  
Hands up high, just let it be  
This is how it feels to be free
