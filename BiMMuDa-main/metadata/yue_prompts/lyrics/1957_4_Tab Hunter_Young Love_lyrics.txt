[Verse]
Young love, first glance  
A heartbeat lost to circumstance  
We don’t know much, but we feel it deep  
A vow we make, a truth we keep  

[Chorus]
Young love, tender flame  
Calling softly out my name  
Hold me close, don’t fade away  
Let this be our forever day  

[Verse]
We whisper dreams in trembling tones  
We build our world on stepping stones  
And though the world may doubt our time  
Our hearts are locked in perfect rhyme  

[Bridge]
Let them laugh or turn aside  
We’ve got nothing left to hide  

[Outro]
Young love, so pure and free  
You’re the only one for me
