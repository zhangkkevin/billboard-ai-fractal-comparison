[Verse]
Every time you pass me by  
I feel a rhythm I can’t deny  
You don’t see what’s in my stare  
But baby, I know love is there  

[Chorus]
I feel for you, I really do  
Every heartbeat sings for you  
It’s not just words, it’s not pretend  
You’ve got the power to transcend  

[Verse]
The way you move, the way you speak  
It makes my knees feel soft and weak  
You shine with fire, full of grace  
And I keep chasing your embrace  

[Bridge]
I’ve kept it in for far too long  
But now I sing you this song  

[Outro]
I feel for you, now can’t you see?  
You're everything to me
