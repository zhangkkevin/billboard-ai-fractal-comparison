[Verse]
So many roads I didn't take  
But I would follow for your sake  
No matter how the seasons go  
You're the place I call my home  

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would  
Go wherever you will go  
Through the fire, through the storm  
Just to keep you safe and warm  

[Verse]
I’ve seen the shadows that you face  
But in your light, I found my place  
If time could bend, if fate was kind  
I’d rewind it all to change your mind  

[Bridge]
I’ll chase the echoes of your name  
'Til I find you once again  

[Chorus]
If I could, then I would  
Go wherever you will go  
Through the fire, through the storm  
Just to keep you safe and warm  

[Outro]
Wherever you will go
