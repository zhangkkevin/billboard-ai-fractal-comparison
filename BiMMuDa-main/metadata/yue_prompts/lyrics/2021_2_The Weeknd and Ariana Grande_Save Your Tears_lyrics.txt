[Verse]
You hide behind a perfect smile  
But I can see the hurt a mile  
You left too soon, with words unsaid  
Now I live inside my head  

[Chorus]
Save your tears, don’t cry for me  
I’m not the same, I let it be  
You broke my heart, then turned away  
Don’t come back to make me stay  

[Verse]
I gave my all, you watched it fall  
Then walked like you felt nothing at all  
Now you say you miss the fire  
But I don’t dance on broken wires  

[Bridge]
I’ll keep the nights, I’ll keep the pain  
But won’t relive it all again  

[Chorus]
Save your tears, don’t cry for me  
I’m not the same, I let it be  
You broke my heart, then turned away  
Don’t come back to make me stay
