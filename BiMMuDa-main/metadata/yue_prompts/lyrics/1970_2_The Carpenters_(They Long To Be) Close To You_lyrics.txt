[Verse]
Every time the sun begins to rise  
I see reflections of you in the skies  
Birds start to sing, the breeze turns new  
All because I’m close to you  

[Chorus]
Why do stars fall down from blue?  
It’s just the world longing for you  
They long to be, like me, close to you  

[Verse]
The gentle way you say my name  
Turns every day into a flame  
Of something pure, something true  
That only lives when I’m with you  

[Bridge]
Every heartbeat finds its cue  
In rhythm just to be with you  

[Outro]
They long to be, like me, close to you
