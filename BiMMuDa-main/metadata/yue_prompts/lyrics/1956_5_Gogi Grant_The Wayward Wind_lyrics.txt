[Verse]
I was born where tumbleweeds roll  
With restless skies and wide control  
My heart beats fast like thunder's call  
Never stayed to watch love fall  

[Chorus]
The wayward wind, it owns my name  
I ride alone and stake no claim  
But still I dream of eyes so kind  
A love I never got to find  

[Verse]
You tried to tie me down with grace  
But freedom pulled me from that place  
Now every road, and every bend  
Reminds me what I lost again  

[Bridge]
If the wind could turn around  
I'd find your voice, I'd find that sound  

[Outro]
But the wayward wind keeps blowin’ strong  
And I keep movin’ on
