[Verse]
I wish I found some better sounds  
That made me feel less run to ground  
Back when I dreamed without regret  
Now I’m just tryna forget  

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time  
To the good old days  
When momma sang us to sleep  
Now we're stressed out in grown-up ways  

[Verse]
Bills and noise and deadlines stack  
Ain’t no map to take me back  
The world grew up, I lost my place  
Now I’m a stranger in this race  

[Bridge]
We traded joy for normal lives  
But we still dream behind our eyes  

[Chorus]
Wish we could turn back time  
To the good old days  
When momma sang us to sleep  
Now we're stressed out in grown-up ways
