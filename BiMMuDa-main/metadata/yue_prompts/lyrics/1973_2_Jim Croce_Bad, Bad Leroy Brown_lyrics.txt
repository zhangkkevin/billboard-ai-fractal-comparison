[Verse]
Down in the South Side of the town  
Leroy Brown came struttin’ ‘round  
Diamond rings and custom shoes  
He never cared what he could lose  

[Chorus]
He’s bad, bad Leroy Brown  
Baddest man to come around  
Meaner than a junkyard dog  
Drinks his whiskey, rolls in fog  

[Verse]
He played his cards with no regret  
And left a trail of unpaid debt  
Took your girl and took your pride  
Then vanished with a crooked smile  

[Bridge]
But one day he met his match  
A shadow quick enough to catch  

[Outro]
Now folks just talk about Leroy Brown  
The legend who once ruled the town
