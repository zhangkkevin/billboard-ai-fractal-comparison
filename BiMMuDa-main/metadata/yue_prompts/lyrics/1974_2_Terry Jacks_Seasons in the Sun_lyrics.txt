[Verse]
Goodbye my friend, it’s time to part  
But know you’ll always have my heart  
We climbed the hills, we chased the wind  
Now I must go where journeys end  

[Chorus]
We had joy, we had fun  
We had seasons in the sun  
But like the tide that comes and goes  
Our story’s written in the snow  

[Verse]
Goodbye to love that made me shine  
To laughs that echoed through the pines  
I’ll carry all those days with grace  
And smile whenever I see your face  

[Bridge]
No regrets, just one more song  
To say I loved you all along  

[Outro]
We had seasons, we had sun  
And now my time has come and gone
