[Verse]
They talk and try to tear us down  
But we keep rising off the ground  
No storm can shake the faith we hold  
Our love is fire, burning bold  

[Chorus]
Love will keep us together  
Through any storm, through any weather  
Even when the nights get long  
Our hearts still beat this faithful song  

[Verse]
You and me, we’ve been through time  
Every scar just proves the climb  
So let them doubt, and let them say  
We’re only growing every day  

[Bridge]
Hold me close and don’t let go  
You're the only truth I know  

[Outro]
Love will keep us strong and free  
You and I, eternally
