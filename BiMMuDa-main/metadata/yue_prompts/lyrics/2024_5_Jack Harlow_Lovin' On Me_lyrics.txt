[Verse]
Tried to leave, but always fall  
Your name still echoes through it all  
You pull me close, I push away  
But I’m still spinning anyway  

[Chorus]
Gravity, can’t break free  
You still got this hold on me  
No escape, I can’t resist  
Every pull feels like a kiss  

[Verse]
Your silence speaks in tidal waves  
I’m trapped in all the love we gave  
I float, then drop, repeat the climb  
But fall for you each time  

[Bridge]
You don’t even try to stay  
But I orbit anyway  

[Chorus]
Gravity, can’t break free  
You still got this hold on me  
No escape, I can’t resist  
Every pull feels like a kiss
