[Verse]
Close your eyes, forget the day  
Let the rhythm sweep us away  
No need to speak, just feel the flow  
Hold me tight and let it go  

[Chorus]
Rock with you, through the night  
In your arms, it all feels right  
Let the music be our guide  
And we’ll dance till morning light  

[Verse]
Your heartbeat matches every beat  
With every step, we feel complete  
The world is gone, it’s just us two  
I’m lost in love when I'm with you  

[Bridge]
Don’t stop, don’t let it fade  
We’re in the magic we just made  

[Outro]
Rock with you, in endless sway  
Let’s keep dancing night away
