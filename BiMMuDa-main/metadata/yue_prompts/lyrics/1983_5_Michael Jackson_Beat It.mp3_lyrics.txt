[Verse]
They push and pull, they start the fire  
But don’t you bow to their desire  
You’ve got the strength, you’ve got the pride  
So stand your ground and walk with stride  

[Chorus]
Just beat it, don’t let ‘em see  
The pain they crave, your dignity  
No need to fight, no need to plead  
Just leave behind what you don’t need  

[Verse]
They draw the lines, they play the game  
But you don’t have to take the blame  
You’ve got a heart, you've got a voice  
You always have the stronger choice  

[Bridge]
In every move, you're not alone  
The fire’s yours, it’s fully grown  

[Outro]
Just beat it, break away  
Let them talk, you’ll be okay
