[Verse]
Memories drift like autumn leaves  
Of golden days and silent eves  
A touch, a glance, a whispered word  
Now echoes I have barely heard  

[Chorus]
The way we were, so bright, so bold  
Before the nights turned dark and cold  
If I could turn the hands of time  
I'd hold you close and make you mine  

[Verse]
We smiled through storms and kissed through rain  
But now I walk with quiet pain  
Your voice still lingers in my mind  
A love so rare, so hard to find  

[Bridge]
We let it go, not knowing why  
But still I miss your last goodbye  

[Outro]
The way we were lives in my soul  
A love once young that made me whole
