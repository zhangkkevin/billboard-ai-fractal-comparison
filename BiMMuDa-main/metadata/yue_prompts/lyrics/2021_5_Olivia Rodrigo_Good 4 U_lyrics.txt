[Verse]
Good for you, you found your peace  
While I’m still trying to find release  
You moved on like nothing broke  
I’m left choking on the smoke  

[Chorus]
Good for you, I guess it’s fine  
I’m still caught in your design  
While you laugh, I scream alone  
Wishing I had never known  

[Verse]
You said love, but meant escape  
Left me lost with no escape  
Now I cry to songs you play  
While you forget me every day  

[Bridge]
One day you’ll feel the sting  
Of everything you didn’t bring  

[Chorus]
Good for you, I guess it’s fine  
I’m still caught in your design  
While you laugh, I scream alone  
Wishing I had never known
