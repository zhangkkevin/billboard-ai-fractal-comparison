[Verse]
When the city sleeps, I rise  
With disco fire in my eyes  
The pulse begins beneath my feet  
And suddenly I feel complete  

[Chorus]
Night fever, it’s calling me  
Moving through the melody  
Heartbeat syncs with every light  
We come alive in endless night  

[Verse]
Glitter raining from above  
Caught inside this rhythm of love  
There’s no tomorrow, just the beat  
Where strangers find their passion sweet  

[Bridge]
In the dark we find our truth  
Dancing like we’ve found our youth  

[Outro]
Night fever, don’t fade away  
You’re the fire that makes me stay
