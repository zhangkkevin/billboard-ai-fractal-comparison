[Verse]
Whispers float on morning air  
Traces of a dream still there  
I chase the sound that once was near  
But all I hold is disappearing  

[Chorus]
Echoes in the sky, calling out  
Fading voices full of doubt  
Can’t rewind what slipped away  
But I still hear them every day  

[Verse]
We spoke in silence, eyes so wide  
Now you’re gone with shifting tide  
Time won’t wait or leave a sign  
Just a song once yours and mine  

[Bridge]
Through the noise, I find a trace  
Of what we had, that quiet grace  

[Chorus]
Echoes in the sky, calling out  
Fading voices full of doubt  
Can’t rewind what slipped away  
But I still hear them every day
