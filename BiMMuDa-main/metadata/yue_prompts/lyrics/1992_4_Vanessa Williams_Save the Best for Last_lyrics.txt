[Verse]
Sometimes love comes dressed in pain  
And hides behind a windowpane  
You never think it’s meant for you  
Until the sky reveals the view  

[Chorus]
You save the best for last  
After all the moments passed  
When you thought your chance was gone  
That’s when love comes along  

[Verse]
I watched you go, I stood aside  
But now you’re here, arms open wide  
You turned my sorrow into song  
And made me feel I still belong  

[Bridge]
The timing wasn’t right before  
But now I see what hearts are for  

[Outro]
You saved the best for me  
A love I thought I'd never see
