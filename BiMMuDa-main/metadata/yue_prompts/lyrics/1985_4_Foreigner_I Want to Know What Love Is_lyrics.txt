[Verse]
I've climbed these mountains made of doubt  
Felt the silence scream and shout  
I’ve wandered through the endless night  
Still searching for that sacred light  

[Chorus]
I want to know what love is  
Show me what the answer is  
I need to feel it in my soul  
To make the broken pieces whole  

[Verse]
I’ve heard the words, I’ve seen the plays  
But never felt those warmer days  
So take my hand and guide me through  
I’m reaching now, I’m trusting you  

[Bridge]
Love’s a path I’ve never known  
But I don’t want to walk alone  

[Outro]
I want to know what love is  
Let it be your heart I miss
