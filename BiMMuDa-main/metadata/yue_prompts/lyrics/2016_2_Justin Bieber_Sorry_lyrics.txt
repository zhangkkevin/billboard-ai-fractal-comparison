[Verse]
I messed up, that much is clear  
I let you down, now you’re not here  
I said some things I can’t erase  
But I still long to see your face  

[Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Can we find a way back from this story?  
I never meant to let you go  
Please tell me you still know  

[Verse]
I replay all the fights, the cries  
Wishing I had made it right  
No excuses, just regret  
You’re the one I won’t forget  

[Bridge]
If I could rewind, I’d choose again  
Start from love and not pretend  

[Chorus]
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Can we find a way back from this story?  
I never meant to let you go  
Please tell me you still know
