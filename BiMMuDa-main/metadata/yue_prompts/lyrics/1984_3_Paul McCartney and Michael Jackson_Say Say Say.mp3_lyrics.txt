[Verse]
Say what you want, but don’t pretend  
I know the truth you tried to bend  
You smile so sweet, then turn away  
Leaving words you’ll never say  

[Chorus]
Say, say, say what you mean  
Don’t dance in shadows, don’t stay unseen  
I gave you time, I gave you trust  
But all I found was scattered dust  

[Verse]
You come and go just like the tide  
I watched my hope get brushed aside  
Your silence speaks much louder still  
Than promises you’ll never fulfill  

[Bridge]
I’d rather hurt than be misled  
So say it now, or leave it dead  

[Outro]
Say, say, say, and mean it clear  
Or walk away and disappear
