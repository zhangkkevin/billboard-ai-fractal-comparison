[Verse]
Don't want your love anymore  
Every tear I cried hit the floor  
I used to smile when you came 'round  
But now I’m just Cathy’s clown  

[Chorus]
You laugh while I fall apart  
You pulled the strings around my heart  
I gave you all, you let me down  
Now I’m walking, Cathy’s clown  

[Bridge]
Fool me once, but never twice  
You took my love, you rolled the dice  

[Outro]
Now someone else can wear the crown  
But I won't be Cathy’s clown
