[Verse]
She walks in with electric flair  
Turns the music into air  
Every eye is locked in place  
She moves with rhythm, style, and grace  

[Chorus]
Dancing machine, light on her feet  
She makes the pulse skip every beat  
Twist and spin, a living flame  
No one else can play her game  

[Verse]
From the disco floor to neon skies  
She takes you high, she makes you fly  
Not a word, just silent heat  
Every move is sweet defeat  

[Bridge]
You can’t touch what moves so fast  
Just feel her fire as she blasts  

[Outro]
Dancing machine, take the lead  
You’re the only dance I need
