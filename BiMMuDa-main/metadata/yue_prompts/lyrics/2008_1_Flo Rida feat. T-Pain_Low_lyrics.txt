[Intro]
Shawty had them apple bottom jeans  
Boots with the fur  

[Verse]
She hit the floor, next thing you know  
We vibin' fast, movin' slow  
Bassline knockin', lights all red  
Got that rhythm stuck in my head  

[Chorus]
She got low, low, low  
Turned it up and stole the show  
Drop it down, then bring it back  
Shawty know how to make it snap  

[Verse]
Club go wild when she steps in  
From the beat drop to the spin  
Every move got me hypnotized  
Lost in those dancin’ eyes  

[Bridge]
When the DJ cut the track  
She still got it bouncin’ back  

[Chorus]
She got low, low, low  
Turned it up and stole the show  
Drop it down, then bring it back  
Shawty know how to make it snap
