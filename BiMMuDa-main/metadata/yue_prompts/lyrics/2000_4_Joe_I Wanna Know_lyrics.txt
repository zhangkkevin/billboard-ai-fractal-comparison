[Verse]
What makes you smile when you’re alone?  
What breaks your heart you’ve never shown?  
Tell me all you try to hide  
Let me love what’s deep inside  

[Chorus]
I wanna know what moves your soul  
What fills the space and makes you whole  
I wanna be the one you trust  
The voice you hear when days are rough  

[Verse]
Do you cry when no one sees?  
Do you fall down to your knees?  
I’m not afraid to hear your pain  
I’ll stay through sunshine and the rain  

[Bridge]
You don’t need to stand alone  
Let me make your heart my home  

[Outro]
I wanna know and I won’t leave  
Just speak your truth and I’ll believe
