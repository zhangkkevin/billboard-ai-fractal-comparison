[Verse]
Because of you, I see the light  
Where once was shadow, now there’s bright  
You took my hand, you showed the way  
And made me hope another day  

[Chorus]
Because of you, I feel again  
You turned my silence into rain  
Each moment with you feels brand new  
And all I am is because of you  

[Bridge]
No song could sing how much you mean  
You’re every breath, you’re every scene  

[Outro]
So if I shine, it’s not alone  
Because of you, I’m finally home
