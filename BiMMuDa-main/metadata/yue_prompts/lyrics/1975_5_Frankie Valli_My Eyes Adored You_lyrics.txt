[Verse]
From across the crowded room  
I watched you bloom from girl to tune  
You never saw the love I gave  
But still, I followed like a wave  

[Chorus]
My eyes adored you  
Though you never really knew  
Every step you took away  
Was written in my heart to stay  

[Verse]
I held the silence like a prayer  
A love so deep I wouldnâ€™t dare  
To say the words, to speak the truth  
That you were all my vanished youth  

[Bridge]
Now time has passed, and still I see  
That part of you lives on in me  

[Outro]
My eyes adored you every day  
Even as you walked away
