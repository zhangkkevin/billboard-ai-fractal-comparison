[Verse]
I gave my heart, I held your hand  
But something slipped like grains of sand  
We said goodbye, we played it cold  
But this regret is growing old  

[Chorus]
Give me one more try  
One more look before goodbye  
I’ll show you what I couldn’t say  
Don’t let this love just fade away  

[Verse]
I made mistakes, I lost my way  
But I’ve been aching every day  
Your name still echoes through the night  
A ghost I long to hold so tight  

[Bridge]
We’re not done, I feel it still  
Say the word and I will  

[Outro]
One more try, just one chance  
To rewrite our romance
