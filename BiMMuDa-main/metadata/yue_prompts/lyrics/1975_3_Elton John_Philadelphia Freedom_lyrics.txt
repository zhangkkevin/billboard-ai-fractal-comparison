[Verse]
City lights and flags that wave  
I’ve found the strength I need to save  
Through every block and every song  
This city's heartbeat makes me strong  

[Chorus]
Philadelphia freedom, my soul's release  
Running wild in streets of peace  
Raise your hands, feel the sound  
Love and rhythm all around  

[Verse]
I don’t need no crown or throne  
This town of dreams is all my own  
With every cheer and every fight  
We dance beneath the liberty light  

[Bridge]
From riverside to neon signs  
This city’s pulse beats in my lines  

[Outro]
Philadelphia freedom, I won’t let go  
You lift me high, you make me glow
