[Intro]  
Ooh yeah, sweet child…  

[Verse]  
She walks like the sound of a rebel rain  
A fire in her laugh, a kiss in her name  
Eyes that hold a midnight flame  
And every look drives me insane  

[Chorus]  
Sweet child of mine, born to shine  
Heart like thunder, soul like wine  
She’s a wild, electric sign  
Yeah, she’s a sweet child of mine  

[Verse]  
She dreams in chords and dances loud  
She don’t need a single crowd  
Tells the truth with every line  
And breaks the silence every time  

[Bridge]  
I’d follow her through storm and fire  
She’s the chaos I admire  

[Outro]  
Oh yeah, sweet child of mine  
Rockin’ love in overdrive
