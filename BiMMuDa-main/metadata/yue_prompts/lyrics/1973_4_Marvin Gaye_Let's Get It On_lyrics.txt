[Verse]
We’ve waited long, we’ve waited slow  
Now let the rhythm take control  
You touch my hand, I feel the flame  
No more games, no more shame  

[Chorus]
Let’s get it on, just you and me  
Let passion set our spirits free  
No need to talk, just feel the night  
And hold me close till morning light  

[Verse]
The world can fade, the time can pause  
Let’s break the rules, rewrite the laws  
Your eyes are stars, your skin the spark  
Let’s love like fire in the dark  

[Bridge]
Don’t hesitate, don’t say a word  
Just move with me and feel the surge  

[Outro]
Let’s get it on, and let it stay  
Like love was made for us today
