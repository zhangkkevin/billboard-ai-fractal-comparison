[Intro]
Remy boys, yeah  

[Verse]
She my trap queen, always right  
Countin’ stacks, we own the night  
From the kitchen to the range  
She with me through every change  

[Chorus]
My trap queen, she hold it down  
Run this hustle, run this town  
Stack that green and flip the flame  
She the queen behind my name  

[Verse]
We whip it up, we make it work  
Turn the struggle into worth  
Got loyalty, she never fold  
She’s a diamond, set in gold  

[Bridge]
They can talk, they don’t compare  
To what we got, we ride with care  

[Chorus]
My trap queen, she hold it down  
Run this hustle, run this town  
Stack that green and flip the flame  
She the queen behind my name
