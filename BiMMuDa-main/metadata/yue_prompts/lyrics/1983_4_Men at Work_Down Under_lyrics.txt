[Verse]
He came from a land of sun and sand  
With mystery carved in every hand  
From dusty roads to oceanâ€™s roar  
He walks where few have gone before  

[Chorus]
I come from a land down under  
Where the skies grow wide with thunder  
The winds speak in a different tongue  
And tales are told, not always sung  

[Verse]
We drink our tea, we trade a smile  
We roam the edge, we walk the mile  
The streets are red, the night is bold  
And every breeze is brave and cold  

[Bridge]
So if you hear the didge at dawn  
Know a wild soul carries on  

[Outro]
I come from a land down under  
Where hearts are loud like rolling thunder
