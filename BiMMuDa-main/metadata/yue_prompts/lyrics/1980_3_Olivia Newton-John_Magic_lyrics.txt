[Verse]
Every time you walk my way  
Colors dance, the skies turn gray  
But with your smile, the sun breaks through  
You’ve got a spell, I fall into  

[Chorus]
You got the magic, can’t explain  
Turning clouds into champagne  
When you’re near, the world aligns  
And every clock forgets the time  

[Verse]
You don’t speak, but I can hear  
A melody that draws me near  
With just a touch, you shift my soul  
You take the broken and make it whole  

[Bridge]
I used to doubt the stars above  
Now they spell your name with love  

[Outro]
You got the magic, now I see  
You’re the wonder meant for me
