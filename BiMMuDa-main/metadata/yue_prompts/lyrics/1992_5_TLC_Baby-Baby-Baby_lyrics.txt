[Verse]
You know you got me in a spin  
With every glance, you draw me in  
I try to act like I’m okay  
But you take my breath away  

[Chorus]
Baby, baby, baby  
You’re the one who drives me crazy  
Got me dreaming every night  
Wishing I could hold you tight  

[Verse]
Your smile is my secret bliss  
Each word a hit, each touch a kiss  
You don’t even know your power  
You bloom in every hour  

[Bridge]
I’ve been patient, I’ve been true  
All I want is more of you  

[Outro]
Baby, baby, don’t you see  
You’re everything to me
