[Verse]
As I walk down empty streets  
I hear the echo of your feet  
You ran from love, from all we knew  
Now I’m chasing ghosts of you  

[Chorus]
I’m a runaway from yesterday  
Lost in words you couldn’t say  
Every mile takes me back  
To the love I now lack  

[Verse]
The wind reminds me of your name  
I keep moving, but it’s the same  
No matter where I lay my head  
You're the voice inside my dread  

[Bridge]
I never thought you'd disappear  
Now I run from what I fear  

[Outro]
Runaway heart, runaway pain  
Still calling out your name
