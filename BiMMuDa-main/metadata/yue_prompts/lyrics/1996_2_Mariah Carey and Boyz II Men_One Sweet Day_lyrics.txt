[Verse]
I never got to say goodbye  
But you still live beyond the sky  
Each tear I cry, I cry for two  
One for me, and one for you  

[Chorus]
One sweet day, we’ll meet again  
Beyond the hurt, beyond the end  
Till then I’ll hold you in my prayer  
And feel your love still in the air  

[Verse]
Your voice still whispers through the breeze  
You bring my busy heart to ease  
I know you watch from up above  
Guiding me with quiet love  

[Bridge]
Time may heal, but won’t erase  
Your smile, your light, your warm embrace  

[Outro]
One sweet day, I’ll find your face  
And feel again your softest grace
