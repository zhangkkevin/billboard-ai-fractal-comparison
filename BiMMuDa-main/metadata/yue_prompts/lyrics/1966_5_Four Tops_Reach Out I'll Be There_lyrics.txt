[Verse]
When the night feels cold and long  
And the world has done you wrong  
Just call my name, I’ll hear your cry  
I’ll be the wings when you can't fly  

[Chorus]
Reach out, I’ll be there  
Through the storm and every care  
You don’t have to face it all  
I’ll catch you if you fall  

[Verse]
No mountain’s too steep, no ocean wide  
That I won’t cross to be your guide  
I’ll light the dark, I’ll ease the pain  
Like sunshine after rain  

[Bridge]
I’m not just words, I’m truly near  
Just speak and I’ll appear  

[Outro]
Reach out, I’ll be there  
With love beyond compare
