[Verse]
I used to dream in two’s and threes  
Now I walk in memories  
The silence rings like a bell  
Telling stories I can’t tell  

[Chorus]
On my own, I face the day  
But your echo doesn’t fade  
I thought love would see us through  
But now I’m learning life anew  

[Verse]
I gave you all, I held on tight  
But some things drift into the night  
Now the bed feels twice as wide  
And I’m alone, with none to hide  

[Bridge]
This isn’t how the tale was drawn  
But here I stand, still holding on  

[Outro]
On my own, but not undone  
The hardest days have just begun
