[Intro]  
I woke up early with the sun in my eyes  
And I couldn’t find my peace  

[Verse]  
I walked through morning in a broken daze  
Thought I left behind those cloudy days  
But every step brought your name back strong  
I knew I couldn’t last too long  

[Chorus]  
You were in my mind  
Everywhere I’d go  
Like a song I used to know  
You were in my mind  
Couldn’t let you be  
You were haunting every part of me  

[Verse]  
Tried to drown it out in city sounds  
Tried to chase it when the sun went down  
But your face was always near  
In every laugh, in every tear  

[Bridge]  
I said I’d move on, and I tried  
But even freedom feels like a lie  

[Chorus]  
You were in my mind  
Everywhere I’d go  
Like a flame that wouldn’t slow  
You were in my mind  
Like a restless sea  
No matter what, you followed me  

[Outro]  
I couldn’t find my peace  
No, I couldn’t find my peace  
You were in my mind
