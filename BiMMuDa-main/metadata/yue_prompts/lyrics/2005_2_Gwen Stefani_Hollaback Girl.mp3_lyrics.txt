[Intro]
Uh huh, this my beat  

[Verse]
You talk the talk, but can’t walk in these shoes  
I'm not the one to pick and choose  
Step to me, you’ll feel the fire  
I’m the spark that lights the wire  

[Chorus]
I ain’t no hollaback girl  
I run this world, I make it whirl  
You can talk, I’ll walk it fast  
Watch me leave you in the past  

[Verse]
I'm the queen, you just pretend  
This battle’s mine, beginning to end  
Bring your words, but I bring heat  
Marchin’ strong to my own beat  

[Bridge]
You want the smoke? Come see  
But I’m not easy, I’m elite  

[Chorus]
I ain’t no hollaback girl  
I run this world, I make it whirl  
You can talk, I’ll walk it fast  
Watch me leave you in the past
