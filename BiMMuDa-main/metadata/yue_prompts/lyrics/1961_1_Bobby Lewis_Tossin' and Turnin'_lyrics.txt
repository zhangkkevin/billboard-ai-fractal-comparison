[Verse]
I couldn't sleep at all last night  
The clock ticked on till morning light  
I tossed and turned, couldn’t find peace  
Till I found your love’s release  

[Chorus]
Tossin’ and turnin’, night and day  
Wishin’ you would come my way  
Can’t rest when you're not near  
Only your voice can calm my fear  

[Verse]
The pillow’s cold, the room’s too still  
Your memory’s a sleeping pill  
I’d give the world for one more kiss  
To bring me back from nights like this  

[Bridge]
Tell me what I’ve got to do  
To bring my dreams back home with you  

[Outro]
Tossin’ and turnin’, through the night  
I need your love to make it right
