[Verse]
Why does the sun still shine above  
When you walked out on our love?  
The birds still sing, the skies are blue  
But none of that means much without you  

[Chorus]
This is the end of the world  
At least, it feels that way to this girl  
The moment you said goodbye  
I saw stars fall from the sky  

[Verse]
The flowers bloom, but I don’t smile  
Each second feels like a thousand miles  
They all go on like nothing’s wrong  
While I’m forgetting how to be strong  

[Bridge]
Is it foolish to still believe  
You might come back to me and grieve?  

[Outro]
The world still turns, but mine’s gone cold  
Without your hand to hold
