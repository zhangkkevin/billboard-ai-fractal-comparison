[Verse]
Hello, Dolly! You’re back again  
Like a breeze through the hearts of men  
We missed your step, your classy stride  
You light this room, you swell with pride  

[Chorus]
Hello, Dolly! Raise your glass  
Time stands still when you walk past  
Every table, every eye  
Waits to catch your sweet reply  

[Verse]
We’ve danced before, let’s dance once more  
Your laugh still shakes the floor  
So don that hat and lift that smile  
Stay with us a little while  

[Bridge]
No one sings like Dolly does  
You’re the queen, forever was  

[Outro]
Hello, Dolly! Never go  
We just love you so
