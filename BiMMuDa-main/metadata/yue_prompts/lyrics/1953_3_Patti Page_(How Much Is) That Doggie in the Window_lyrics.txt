[Verse]
How much is that doggie in the window?  
The one with the waggle and bark  
He looks like he'd chase all my troubles  
And cuddle me close after dark  

[Chorus]
I want that doggie, big bright eyes  
He don’t need riches or a prize  
Just give me that furry little friend  
To love me from end to end  

[Verse]
I’ll feed him treats and take long walks  
And share with him my deepest talks  
A bark or two, a tail that sways  
He’ll bring me joy on rainy days  

[Bridge]
He doesn’t care what clothes I wear  
As long as I am always there  

[Chorus]
I want that doggie, big bright eyes  
He don’t need riches or a prize  
Just give me that furry little friend  
To love me from end to end
