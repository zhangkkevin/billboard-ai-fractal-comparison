[Verse]
He’s got the words you wanna hear  
But not the heart to keep you near  
He makes you laugh, but not for long  
You’re still searching for where you belong  

[Chorus]
I’m everything you want  
The truth you never caught  
While he’s playing make-believe  
I’m the one who’ll never leave  

[Verse]
You chase a dream that fades to grey  
But I’ve been here every day  
Watching you fall through his disguise  
When I could love you without lies  

[Bridge]
Open your eyes, don’t look too far  
The one you need is where you are  

[Outro]
I’m everything you want to feel  
The only love that’s real
