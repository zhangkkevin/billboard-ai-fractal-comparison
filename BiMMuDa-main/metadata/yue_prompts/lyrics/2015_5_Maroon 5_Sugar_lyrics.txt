[Verse]
I'm craving more than candy sweet  
Your love is what I need to eat  
Every touch, a sugar rush  
Can’t get enough of your soft crush  

[Chorus]
Sugar, I need it bad  
You’re the sweetest thing I’ve had  
Come on down and melt this heart  
Let’s not tear this world apart  

[Verse]
I’ve been lonely, I’ve been dry  
You bring the sparkle in my sky  
Your kiss is like a dream I keep  
A honeyed dive into the deep  

[Bridge]
Let me in, don’t hold away  
I’ll be your sweet tooth every day  

[Chorus]
Sugar, I need it bad  
You’re the sweetest thing I’ve had  
Come on down and melt this heart  
Let’s not tear this world apart
