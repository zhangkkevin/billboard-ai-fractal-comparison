[Verse]
Do you ever feel too small  
Like no one sees you at all?  
But deep inside, a spark will rise  
To paint your name across the skies  

[Chorus]
You’re a firework, don’t you see?  
Meant to shine eternally  
Let it burst, let it fly  
You're the color in the sky  

[Verse]
When the world tries to dim your flame  
Don’t forget you own your name  
You were born to burn so bright  
A beacon in the darkest night  

[Bridge]
Open up and light the fuse  
You’ve got nothing left to lose  

[Chorus]
You’re a firework, don’t you see?  
Meant to shine eternally  
Let it burst, let it fly  
You're the color in the sky
