[Verse]
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Just pretend that we're together all alone  
Tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low  
And you can tell your friend there with you, he’ll have to go  

[Chorus]
He don’t know the things we’ve done  
All the love and all the fun  
But if your heart’s not truly mine  
Then don’t you cross that line  

[Bridge]
Though I whisper soft and low  
If you love him, then I’ll go  

[Outro]
But if you still want me so  
Just tell him he’ll have to go
