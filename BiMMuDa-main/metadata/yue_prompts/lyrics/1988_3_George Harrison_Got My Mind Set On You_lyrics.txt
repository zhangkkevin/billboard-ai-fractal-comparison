[Verse]  
I’ve been walkin' through the fire  
Climbin' dreams and rising higher  
There’s one thing that pulls me through  
Every road leads back to you  

[Chorus]  
I got my mind set on you  
No one else will ever do  
Every heartbeat, every day  
You’re the light that guides my way  

[Verse]  
I tried to chase another dream  
But nothing’s ever what it seems  
When I’m lost and need a sign  
You're the thought that's always mine  

[Bridge]  
You’re the reason, strong and true  
I got my mind set on you  

[Outro]  
Yeah, I got my mind set on you  
And I won’t stop ‘til I see it through
