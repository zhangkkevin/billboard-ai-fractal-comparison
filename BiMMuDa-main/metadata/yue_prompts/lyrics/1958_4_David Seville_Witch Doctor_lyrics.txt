[Intro]  
I went to see a wise old man  
To help me with my master plan  
I told him that I loved a girl  
But she just made my poor head whirl

[Verse]  
He looked at me with a wild old grin  
He said, “My boy, let’s begin!”  
He mixed up potions, strange and bright  
Then shouted spells into the night!

[Chorus]  
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah  
Ting-tang, walla-walla bing-bang  
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah  
Ting-tang, walla-walla boom!

[Verse]  
He gave me charms and rabbit feet  
Told me, “Dance and tap your feet!”  
So I did the crazy dance  
Hoping I would get a chance

[Chorus]  
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah  
Ting-tang, walla-walla bing-bang  
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah  
Ting-tang, walla-walla boom!

[Bridge]  
Now I’ve got her by my side  
Thanks to that old magic guide  
She thinks I’m a charming guy  
Even though she don’t know why!

[Chorus]  
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah  
Ting-tang, walla-walla bing-bang  
Ooh-ee, ooh-ah-ah  
Thanks to the Witch Doctor’s zing-zang!
