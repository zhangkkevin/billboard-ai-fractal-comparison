[Verse]
We met beneath the twilight sky  
I saw the truth in your shy eyes  
Our families said we can’t be  
But I believe in destiny  

[Chorus]
This is a love story, bold and bright  
We held on through the darkest night  
You said, “Baby, run away with me”  
And I said, “Yes, just wait and see”  

[Verse]
We carved our names in hidden stone  
Built our dreams and made our own  
Even when the world said no  
We held tight and didn’t let go  

[Bridge]
I heard you whisper through the rain  
“Let’s write a tale they can’t explain”  

[Chorus]
This is a love story, bold and bright  
We held on through the darkest night  
You said, “Baby, run away with me”  
And I said, “Yes, just wait and see”  

[Outro]
Our love story
