But now I slam the closing door  
You thought I’d fall, but I broke through  
And now I see the real truth  

[Bridge]
You were the weight I had to lose

[Chorus]
Since you been gone, I’ve found my light  
No more shadows, no more fights  
I’m not afraid to stand alone  
Since you been gone, I’ve grown
