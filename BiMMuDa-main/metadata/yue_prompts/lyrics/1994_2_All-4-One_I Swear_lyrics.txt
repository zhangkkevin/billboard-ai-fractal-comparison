[Verse]
When the night grows cold and long  
I’ll be there, holding strong  
You can trust in what I say  
I’ll never walk away  

[Chorus]
I swear, by the moon and the stars above  
To guard you with my endless love  
Through every high and every low  
I’ll be the one you’ll always know  

[Verse]
Even when the world turns gray  
I’ll be your sun through every day  
My heart belongs to only you  
In every word, in all I do  

[Bridge]
Time may change the world we see  
But it won't change what's in me  

[Outro]
I swear, forever starts with you  
And every vow I make is true
