[Verse]
Workin' all day, just to come home  
Feelin’ like I’m out here on my own  
You say you care, but where you been?  
I need more than texts at ten  

[Chorus]
Work, work, that’s all we do  
But I need time to vibe with you  
Less talk, more action now  
Show me love, I’ll show you how  

[Verse]
You always run, you never stay  
But love don't work that kind of way  
I want the truth, not just a game  
Don’t let it all go down in flames  

[Bridge]
Don’t make me fight for every kiss  
Let’s turn the work into some bliss  

[Chorus]
Work, work, that’s all we do  
But I need time to vibe with you  
Less talk, more action now  
Show me love, I’ll show you how
