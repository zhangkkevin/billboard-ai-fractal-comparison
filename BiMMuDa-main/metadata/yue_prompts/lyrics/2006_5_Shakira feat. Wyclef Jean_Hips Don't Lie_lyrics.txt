[Intro]
Ladies up in here tonight  
No fighting  

[Verse]
I feel the rhythm in your soul  
Every move, you take control  
The way you dance, it tells the truth  
You ain’t got nothin' left to prove  

[Chorus]
Your hips don’t lie, they speak so clear  
Telling me what I need to hear  
Move to the music, wild and free  
You’re the flame, the energy  

[Verse]
Heartbeat sync with the drum  
You know exactly where you're from  
This floor's your kingdom, your parade  
Every step, a serenade  

[Bridge]
Don’t hide the fire in your eyes  
It’s dancing under moonlit skies  

[Chorus]
Your hips don’t lie, they speak so clear  
Telling me what I need to hear  
Move to the music, wild and free  
You’re the flame, the energy  

[Outro]
No fighting
