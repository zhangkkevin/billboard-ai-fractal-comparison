[Verse]
You see me try, you see me cry  
But you just keep on walking by  
I can move a mountain, touch the sky  
But I still can't make you reply  

[Chorus]
I can't get next to you  
No matter what I do  
You light my soul and then walk through  
I can’t break the space between us two  

[Verse]
I could turn rain to summer fire  
But you won't give in to desire  
I call your name, you just pretend  
Like we were never more than friends  

[Bridge]
I’ve done it all to catch your glance  
Still you won't give me a chance  

[Outro]
I can't get next to you  
But I'm still trying, it's true
