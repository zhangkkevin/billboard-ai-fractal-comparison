[Intro]
Uh-huh, uh-huh  
Good girl gone bad  

[Verse]
You had my heart inside your hand  
But storms roll in, and things don't go as planned  
But when the rain begins to pour  
I’ll be the one you're looking for  

[Chorus]
You can stand under my umbrella  
Through the lightning, through the weather  
I’ll keep you close, I’ll keep you dry  
Together we’ll hold back the sky  

[Verse]
It’s more than words, it’s deeper still  
When life gets heavy, I’ll be your will  
I’ll be the strength when you feel weak  
A voice of hope when you can't speak  

[Bridge]
These arms are wide, these hands are sure  
With me, you’ll always feel secure  

[Chorus]
You can stand under my umbrella  
Through the lightning, through the weather  
I’ll keep you close, I’ll keep you dry  
Together we’ll hold back the sky  

[Outro]
Ella, ella, eh, eh
