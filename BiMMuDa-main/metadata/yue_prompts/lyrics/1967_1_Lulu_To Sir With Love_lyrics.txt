[Verse]
How do you thank someone  
Who took your hand when you had none?  
Taught me more than books could do  
With every look, you pulled me through  

[Chorus]
To sir, with love, I raise my voice  
You helped me see I had a choice  
The lessons lived, not just taught  
A wiser soul your guidance brought  

[Verse]
From trembling steps to standing tall  
You saw the beauty in it all  
And now I walk with pride and grace  
Because you showed me my own place  

[Bridge]
You gave me dreams I never dared  
A voice that spoke because you cared  

[Outro]
So if goodbye must come today  
I thank you more than words can say
