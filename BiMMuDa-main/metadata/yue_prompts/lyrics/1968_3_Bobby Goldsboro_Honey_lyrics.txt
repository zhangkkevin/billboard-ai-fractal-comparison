[Verse]
She used to laugh beneath the trees  
Chasing sunlight through the breeze  
Planted flowers just to smile  
And sat with me a little while  

[Chorus]
Honey, sweet and soft and true  
Every day I’m missing you  
Gone too soon, you flew away  
But love like yours will always stay  

[Verse]
She hummed to songs I never knew  
Made cloudy skies feel bright and new  
And now I walk those paths alone  
Still hearing echoes from our home  

[Bridge]
Time may pass, but won’t erase  
Her gentle hands, her warming face  

[Outro]
Honey, you're my yesterday  
And still my heart today
