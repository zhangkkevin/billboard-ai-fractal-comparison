[Verse]
Built from pieces of the past  
We found a love that's built to last  
Through every storm, we held our place  
Now every doubt we can erase  

[Chorus]
Nothing’s gonna stop us now  
Not even time could show us how  
To break what we began  
Together, we can stand  

[Verse]
They said we’d fall, they said we’d break  
But they don’t know the hearts at stake  
You are my home, my only vow  
And nothing’s gonna stop us now  

[Bridge]
With every breath, we forge the way  
We’re writing love with each new day  

[Outro]
Nothing’s gonna tear us down  
In your love, I’ve found my crown
