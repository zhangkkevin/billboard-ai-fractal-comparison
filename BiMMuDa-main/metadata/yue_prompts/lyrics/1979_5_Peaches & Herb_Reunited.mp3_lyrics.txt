[Verse]
I thought the end had come and gone  
But here we are, where we belong  
The silence broke with just one call  
And now we rise after the fall  

[Chorus]
Reunited, and it feels so right  
Like the stars returned our night  
Two hearts healing in the light  
Back again, holding tight  

[Verse]
We tried to live with space between  
But found out love was evergreen  
I missed your laugh, your quiet grace  
And now I'm home, in your embrace  

[Bridge]
Time apart just proved the truth  
That I was always meant for you  

[Outro]
Reunited, now we know  
This time, we wonâ€™t let go
