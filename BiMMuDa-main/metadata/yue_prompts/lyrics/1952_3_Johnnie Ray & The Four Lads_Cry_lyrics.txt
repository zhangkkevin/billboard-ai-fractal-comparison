[Verse]
If your tears could talk tonight  
They’d tell a tale of lost delight  
Of hands that held and then let go  
Of dreams we’ll never get to know  

[Chorus]
Cry, if you feel alone  
Let it break you, let it show  
I’ll be the echo in your sigh  
Don’t be afraid to cry  

[Verse]
I wore a smile I didn’t feel  
But pain has ways to make us real  
Now every sob is like a song  
Telling me where we went wrong  

[Bridge]
If crying is all that’s left  
I’ll still love you with each breath  

[Chorus]
Cry, if you feel alone  
Let it break you, let it show  
I’ll be the echo in your sigh  
Don’t be afraid to cry
