[Verse]
I don’t know what’s down this road  
But I’ll ride it with you slow  
You and me, just take it day by day  
Let the wind show us the way  

[Chorus]
If it’s meant to be, we’ll find the time  
Every twist, every climb  
No need to rush, no need to see  
Just let it go, if it’s meant to be  

[Verse]
I’ve been hurt, I’ve walked alone  
But with you, it feels like home  
Don’t need a map, don’t need a plan  
Just the touch of your hand  

[Bridge]
We don’t need to know what’s next  
We just take it step by step  

[Chorus]
If it’s meant to be, we’ll find the time  
Every twist, every climb  
No need to rush, no need to see  
Just let it go, if it’s meant to be
