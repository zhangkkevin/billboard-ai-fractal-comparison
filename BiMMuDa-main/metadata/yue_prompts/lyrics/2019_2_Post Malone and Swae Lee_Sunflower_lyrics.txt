[Verse]
You’re a light that never fades  
Even when the colors trade  
You bloom in the hardest place  
A gentle fire, a wild grace  

[Chorus]
You're my sunflower, always there  
Even when the sky won’t care  
I try to leave, but you remain  
Soaked in sun, and washed in rain  

[Verse]
You don't say much, but I feel it all  
You catch my tears before they fall  
When the days turn dark and gray  
You find a way to stay  

[Bridge]
You grow where no one dares to try  
That’s why I can’t say goodbye  

[Chorus]
You're my sunflower, always there  
Even when the sky won’t care  
I try to leave, but you remain  
Soaked in sun, and washed in rain
