[Intro]
Boom boom boom, gotta get that  

[Verse]
I step on the scene, futuristic flow  
Light years ahead, now you know  
Beats so hot, it’s meltin’ steel  
Shock the crowd with that digital feel  

[Chorus]
Boom boom pow, we bring the sound  
Make you wanna jump and break it down  
Electric vibes, the future’s here  
Feel that bass ring in your ear  

[Verse]
From L.A. to outer space  
Droppin' hits all over the place  
We on a mission, no delay  
Laser light up your DNA  

[Bridge]
Robotic moves and cosmic grace  
Feel the pulse all in your face  

[Chorus]
Boom boom pow, we bring the sound  
Make you wanna jump and break it down  
Electric vibes, the future’s here  
Feel that bass ring in your ear
