[Verse]
I see you smile across the room  
But I still feel the cold and gloom  
You found someone, and that’s okay  
But I still hurt in every way  

[Chorus]
So I look away, hold back the tears  
Hide the truth, swallow the years  
I loved you more than words can say  
But now I just look away  

[Verse]
We used to dance in perfect time  
Now I just echo every rhyme  
You’re moving on, and I pretend  
That I don’t miss what had to end  

[Bridge]
It’s better now, that you don’t see  
The pain of what you meant to me  

[Outro]
So I look away, let it be  
Even though you're still in me
