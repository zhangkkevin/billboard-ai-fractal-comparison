[Verse]
Wanted—someone to understand  
To hold my heart, to take my hand  
You don’t need fame or fancy clothes  
Just be the one who truly knows  

[Chorus]
Wanted, like the air I breathe  
Like dreams that never choose to leave  
Someone who sees behind the pain  
And stays through sunshine and through rain  

[Verse]
I’ve waited long and wandered wide  
But never found that place to hide  
Where love could knock and stay awhile  
And warm my soul with just a smile  

[Bridge]
If you’re out there, hear this song  
Come find the heart you’ve searched for long  

[Outro]
Wanted, more than words can say  
Someone who’ll never walk away
