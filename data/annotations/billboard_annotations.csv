Thought I was wise, thought I was cool
But now I see you had your say
While I watched time drift away

Each promise made, each story spun  
Still stings beneath the setting sun

It’s too late, we can’t go back
Time rolled on without a track
The words are soft, the nights are still
But we can’t change the way we feel

Now silence dances through the hall
We smile like we both understand
Love sometimes slips right through your hand

I knew then what forever meant  
In that one moment, heaven sent  
You held the stars within your eyes  
And turned my silence into skies

[Chorus]
Alone again, naturally  
The world forgot to wait for me  
I tried to smile through broken glass  
But memories hold on so fast

I read the news on a winter's day  
The songs we loved had slipped away  
No more guitars to fill the night  
Just silent halls and neon light

Bye, bye, the songs we used to know  
Drove our dreams through the dust and snow  
And though the rhythm’s gone from the sky  
We’ll still remember, we won’t say goodbye

The crowd grew still, the groove had died  
But we held hands, still swaying slow  
To songs from years and lives ago

It was the sound of you and me

Every breath just pulls me through  
You were the song, the only truth  
And now I'm lost in all I knew

One touched by time and love's disgrace

Diamond rings and custom shoes

He’s bad, bad Leroy Brown  
Baddest man to come around  
Meaner than a junkyard dog  
Drinks his whiskey, rolls in fog

He played his cards with no regret  
And left a trail of unpaid debt  
Took your girl and took your pride  
Then vanished with a crooked smile

A shadow quick enough to catch

Now folks just talk about Leroy Brown  
The legend who once ruled the town"

And brings it pouring from inside

But I was never there at all
