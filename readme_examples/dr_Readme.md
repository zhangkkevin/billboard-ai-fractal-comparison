DiffRhythm (Chinese: 谛韵, Dì Yùn) is the ***first*** open-sourced diffusion-based music generation model that is capable of creating full-length songs. The name combines "Diff" (referencing its diffusion architecture) with "Rhythm" (highlighting its focus on music and song creation). The Chinese name 谛韵 (Dì Yùn) phonetically mirrors "DiffRhythm", where "谛" (attentive listening) symbolizes auditory perception, and "韵" (melodic charm) represents musicality.

## News and Updates

* 📌 Join Us on Discord! [![Discord](https://dcbadge.limes.pink/api/server/https://discord.gg/vUD4zgTpJa)](https://discord.gg/vUD4zgTpJa)

* **2025.5.9 🔥** **DiffRhythm-v1.2 Official Launch!**

   Version 1.2 largely resolves repetition and omission issues, significantly improves audio quality and arrangement with richer instrumentation, and enables song editing and continuation with advanced understanding of music structure and style.

* **2025.3.15 🔥** **DiffRhythm-full Official Release: Complete Music Generation!**  

    The wait is over - **285s full-length music generation** is now live!  

    *The symphony evolves. What impossible music will you compose next?*

* **2025.3.11 💻** DiffRhythm can now run on MacOS! 

* **2025.3.9 🔥** **DiffRhythm Update: Text-to-Music and Pure Music Generation!**  

    We're excited to announce two groundbreaking features now live in our open-source music model:  

    🎯 **Text-Based Style Prompts**  
    Describe styles/scenes in words (e.g., `Jazzy Nightclub Vibe`, `Pop Emotional Piano` or `Indie folk ballad, coming-of-age themes, acoustic guitar picking with harmonica interludes`) — *no audio reference needed!*  

    🎧 **Instrumental Mode**  
    Generate pure music with wild prompts like:  
    ```bash  
    "Arctic research station, theremin auroras dancing with geomagnetic storms"  
    ```

    ✨ Special Thanks to community contributor @Jourdelune for implementing these features via #PR29!

    **Full Release Notes**: See [src/update_alert.md](src/update_alert.md) for  details, demos, and roadmap.

    Break the rules. Make music that shouldn't exist.

* **2025.3.7 🔥** **DiffRhythm** is now officially licensed under the **Apache 2.0 License**! 🎉 As the first diffusion-based music generation model, DiffRhythm opens up exciting new possibilities for AI-driven creativity in music. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or music enthusiast, we invite you to explore, innovate, and build upon this foundation. 

* **2025.3.6 🔥** The local deployment guide is now available.

* **2025.3.4 🔥** We released the [DiffRhythm paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01183) and [Huggingface Space demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm).

## Model Versions

|  Model   | HuggingFace |
|  ----  | ----  |
| ✨ **DiffRhythm-v1.2** (1m35s) — *New!*  | https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-1_2 |
| DiffRhythm-base (1m35s)  | https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-base |
| DiffRhythm-full (4m45s)  | https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-full |
| DiffRhythm-vae  | https://huggingface.co/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm-vae |

## Docker installation
You just need the 3 files inside the folder docker. Do as it follows:<br/>
- Clone the project or copy the files<br/>
- cd into the folder<br/>
- Edit your docker compose biding folders
- docker compose up -d (or docker-compose up -d depending on your version)<br/>
- docker exec -it DiffRhythm bash<br/>

You will be in the terminal ready for use. Just go to /home/app/scripts and run infer_prompt_ref.sh
## Inference

Following the steps below to clone the repository and install the environment.

```bash 
# clone and enter the repositry
git clone https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm.git
cd DiffRhythm

# install the environment

## espeak-ng
# For Debian-like distribution (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)
sudo apt-get install espeak-ng
# For RedHat-like distribution (e.g. CentOS, Fedora, etc.) 
sudo yum install espeak-ng
# For MacOS
brew install espeak-ng
# For Windows
# Please visit https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng/releases to download .msi installer

## create python environment
conda create -n diffrhythm python=3.10
conda activate diffrhythm

## OR you can use classic Python virtual enviroment instead of conda
python -m venv venv
# activate venv on Linux
source venv/bin/activate
# activate venv on Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

## install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On Linux you can now simply use the inference script:
```bash
# For inference using a reference WAV file
bash scripts/infer_wav_ref.sh
# For inference using a text prompt reference
bash scripts/infer_prompt_ref.sh
```

But before running the inference on Windows, make sure you set the user enviroment variables:\
`PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_LIBRARY` -> `C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG\libespeak-ng.dll`\
`PHONEMIZER_ESPEAK_PATH` -> `C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG`\
Change `C:\Program Files\eSpeak NG` to your eSpeak installation directory and reboot your PC to apply changes.

*Installing Japanese voices, mbrola binaries and unpacking an mbrola_ph folder (as described [here](https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm/issues/15) and [here](https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm/issues/22)) are **no longer required** when running on Windows. See https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm/issues/17#issuecomment-2705058729, [this](https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm/commit/2ea9424274df10670ddc613b5d61cc16d13e2b88) and [this commit](https://github.com/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm/commit/1ad7229e1a774c9a2a0c4888103dd4ea7176aebb).*

After this, you will also be able to run inference scripts on Windows (please note that English lyrics will be used here):
```batch
rem : For inference using a reference WAV file
call scripts\infer_wav_ref.bat
rem : For inference using a text prompt reference
call scripts\infer_prompt_ref.bat
```

Example files of lrc and reference audio can be found in `infer/example`.

You can use [the tools](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ASLP-lab/DiffRhythm) we provide on huggingface to generate the lrc.

**Note that DiffRhythm-base requires a minimum of 8G of VRAM. To meet the 8G VRAM requirement, use the `--chunked` argument when running the inference. Higher VRAM may be required if chunked decoding is disabled.**

## Training

Coming soon...

We do not make any profit from this model. Our goal is to provide a high-quality base model for music generation, fostering innovation in AI music and contributing to the advancement of human creativity. We hope that DiffRhythm will serve as a foundation for further research and development in the field of AI-generated music.

DiffRhythm enables the creation of original music across diverse genres, supporting applications in artistic creation, education, and entertainment. While designed for positive use cases, potential risks include unintentional copyright infringement through stylistic similarities, inappropriate blending of cultural musical elements, and misuse for generating harmful content. To ensure responsible deployment, users must implement verification mechanisms to confirm musical originality, disclose AI involvement in generated works, and obtain permissions when adapting protected styles.
